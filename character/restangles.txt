= Setting rest angles on bones =
#parent: buildingrigs

An IK solver uses the _rest angle_ to choose how the joint bends as the
goal is moved. For example, you can set the rest angle of the bones
around an elbow joint to control which way the elbow bends.

When you create a bone, the rest angle is 0, 0, 0. (The actual angles
are defined in the bone's pre-transform values.)

:task:Edit the rest position of a bone:
    # Choose __Edit > Objects > Bone Kinematic Override: IK Rest Pose__.

      This turns off the IK goal's control over the bone chain. The
      bone rotations all pop back to their rest angles.

    # Use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose the [Transform
      tool|/basics/tools].

    # Select the bone you want to edit, then click ((RMB)) to finish
      the selection.

    # Press ((R)) to switch to the rotate manipulator. Rotate the
      bone to its new rest position.

    # Choose __Edit > Objects > Bone Kinematic Override: None__ to
      turn IK control of the bone chain back on.

      Now when you use the [Pose tool|/shelf/pose] to pose
      the bone chain, the joint should bend differently.
