In Houdini, you can set up characters using two different styles. The
two styles both have advantages and disadvantages, and allow different
types of convenience.

Simple, default style:
    The simple style is the style for which Houdini's UI is optimized: a
    single end goal for each IK bone chain, and a single IK solver for
    each bone chain.

Complex, blended style:
    The complex style involves creating multiple goals for a bone chain
    that live in different spaces (for example, character space and
    shoulder space for an arm goal) and blending between them based on
    how the animator wants to pose at any given moment.

    The mechanics of setting up bones with this style are described in
    [blending between multiple IK goals|ikconstraints] .

            * Seamless usability with [Pose tool|/shelf/pose]:
              show blend handle, snap to IK, snap to rotates menu items;
              "smart" goal snaps to bone end automatically. (See
              [IK/Rotation blending|animation]  for information
              about these UI conveniences.)

            * It's the default: it works as expected without editing.

            * Faster interaction than complex method.

        td>>
            * Single end goal means you have to choose one space for it
              to live in. Can't pose in different spaces.

        td>>
            *Complex*
        td>>
            * Tremendous control over the space in which you pose each
              goal.

            * Rig can be adapted to different animation styles.

        td>>
            * More difficult to rig. Requires setting up [multiple
              goals|ikconstraints] and a [Blend node|Node:obj/blend] to blend between
              them.

            * Pose tool loses IK/Rotation convenience features (see
              [IK/Rotation blending|animation] ).

            * Potentially slower than the simple setup.

NOTE:
    For another perspective on rigging style, see  [posing using
    temporary IK|pose]  on building a rig without any IK and
    using Houdini's temporary IK feature to pose.
