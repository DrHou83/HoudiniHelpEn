= Using Onion Skinning =

Onion skinning is a viewport visualization for animation that displays an animated object at multiple frames. The current frame is displayed normally and the other animation frames, or 'onion skins', are displayed as 
partially transparent ghosts. By showing the object across multiple frames, the artist can get a sense of its movement.

Onion skinning is enabled on a [Geometry object|Node:obj/geo] using the __Onion Skinning__ menu in the __Misc__ tab. The number of frames displayed, frame step, and skin opacity can all be set in the __Viewport__ tab of the [3D Display Options |/ref/windows/displayopts_3d].

== Enable Onion Skinning ==

Onion skinning can be enabled on a [Geometry object|Node:obj/geo] by setting the __Onion Skinning__ parameter to __Transform Only__ or __Full Deformation__.

Transform Only:
    The geometry from the current frame is used, while the object transform is animated. This is faster than __Full Deformation__ if the underlying geometry changes over time.

Full Deformation:
    The geometry is recooked at each frame along with the object transform.

Onion skinning can also be globally disabled by toggling off the __Onion Skinning__ toggle in the menu of [Icon:VIEW/display_objects], in the right viewport toolbar. Turning on the global onion skinning display option will restore onion skinning for those objects that have it enabled.

NOTE:
   Onion skinning is not shown on ghosted objects. If an object has onion skinning enabled and a different object is entered to the SOP level, the onion skinning will be disabled.


== Onion Skinning Options ==

There are several display options related to onion skinning in the __Viewport__ tab of the [3D Display Options |/ref/windows/displayopts_3d]. They allow you to change:

* The number of skins before and after the current frame.
* The frame increment between skins.
* The tinting of skins before and skins after, independently.
* The opacity of the skins, from 0 to 100%.

Increasing the number of skins displayed will adversely affect playback performance, especially if __Full Deformation__ mode is used.


== Onion Skinning Tips ==

* Only use onion skinning on one or a few objects at a time. The performance hit can make scrubbing and playback slow.

* If the deformation of the geometry is minimal, try __Transform Only__ to improve performance.

* Reducing the number of skins can also improve performance.

* For slowly moving animations, increase the __Frame Step__ display option to more easily see the animation. Similarly, fast animations can be better visualized with a small __Frame Step__.

* Adjusting the skin opacity can help in situations where the skins are very crowded. This can be done in the __Viewport__ tab of the [3D Display Options |/ref/windows/displayopts_3d].
