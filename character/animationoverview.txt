= Animation Overview =

It is useful to open the Animation Desktop when animating a character. This is a special desktop layout that includes the [channel list|/ref/panes/chanlist], [animation editor|/ref/panes/animeditor], and [two viewport layouts|/basics/view]. You can access it by clicking the __Windows__ menu and selecting __Desktop > Animate__.

Animating a character is not much different from animating a bag of flour or a bouncing ball. The same basic methods are used. This section of the Character chapter is aimed at addressing the character specific aspects of animation. For general information on animation see the [Animation|/anim/] chapter.
