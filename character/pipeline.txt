== Transferring capture attributes between characters ==

In Houdini, you can transfer attributes between objects based on their
3D proximity. One application of this feature is to transfer capture
attributes to a new version of a character model with a different
topology.

    #  [Go to|/ref/panes/network]  the SOP level containing the geometry between
      which you want to transfer attributes.

    # Set the  [display flag|/nodes/sop/]  on the geometry you want to
      transfer _to_. Select the node _before_ the deform operator, if
      any.

    # Set the  [footprint flag|/nodes/sop/]  on the geometry to want to
      transfer _from_ so it is also visible.

    # If necessary, transform the models so they
      overlap each other in 3D as closely as possible. The attribute
      transfer operator works based on the proximity of the "from" and
      "to" geometry.

    # In the viewer, use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose the
      [AttribTransfer operator|Node:sop/attribtransfer].

    # In the network editor, select the model you want to transfer
      _from_, then click ((RMB)) to finish the selection. The model will
      highlight in yellow.

    # In the network editor, select the model you want to transfer _to_,
      then click ((RMB)) to finish the selection. The old model will
      highlight in cyan.

    # Select the new attribute transfer node in the network editor. In
      the parameter editor, on the __Attributes__ tab, turn on the
      __Detail__ checkbox.

    # Turn off the footprint flag of the "from" geometry. The "to"
      geometry should have the transferred attributes.
