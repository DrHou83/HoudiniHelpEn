= Posing a character =

You pose characters with the [Pose tool|/shelf/pose]. Using this
tool at the object level, you can manipulate control objects and bones
using the handles set up by the technical director.

With digital asset characters, not all controls appear when you first
select the asset. Digital asset characters can use nested digital assets
with simpler interfaces that let you focus on different body parts such
as arms or legs. In some cases, bones might be left without controls to
allow for the animation of joint rotations.

== How to pose a character ==

:task:Select the entire character:
    # In the viewer pane, turn on __Select > Select Entire
      Subnet__.

    # Use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu] , or press ((S)), to choose
      the [Transform tool|/basics/ui].

    # Select the character, then click ((RMB)) to finish the
      selection.

    # When you're done, turn off __Select > Select Entire Subnet__.

:task:Pose parts of the character:
    # Make sure __Select > Select Entire Subnet__ is off.

    # Turn off __Select > Secure Selection__. This will make it much
      easier to grab different parts of the character because you
      won't have to choose __Select > Reselect Geometry__ every
      time.

    # Use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose the [Pose
      tool|/shelf/pose].

    # Select a joint or pose handle (null object), then press
      ((RMB)) to finish the selection.

    # Use the translate ((T)), rotate ((R)), and scale ((E))
      manipulators to move the joint/handle.

:task:Switch between separate manipulators and one manipulator for multiple selected items in the Pose tool:
    Press ((X)), or press ((RMB)) and choose __Global Transform Handle__.
    
<!--
:task:Capture pose:
    * TBD.
-->

:task:Use a digital asset's controls:
    # Select the asset in the  [network editor
      pane|/ref/panes/network] .

    # In the  [parameter editor pane|/ref/panes/parms] ,
      click the __Controls__ tab to show the parameters that have
      been promoted up to the asset level.

:task:Access nested digital assets:
    When you  set up a nested character asset,
    you can create null objects that represent nested assets
    inside the main asset. Select the null object with the Pose
    tool to select the nested asset.

== How to keyframe a character pose ==(pose)

See the [animation section|/anim/] for more information on keyframing.

:task:Keyframe an IK goal:
    * Use the [Transform tool|/basics/ui] to select
      the goal and press ((Shift + T)) to set keyframes on its
      translation parameters.

:task:Keyframe a blended IK/rotation set-up:
    # Use the  [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu]  to choose the [Pose
      tool|/shelf/pose].

      To set keyframes on an blending setup, you must key not only
      the translation of the goal but also the rotation of the
      joints and the blend attribute on the Kin_CHOP. This is easy
      with the Pose tool.

    # Press ((K)) to set keyframes on the pose handles. This keys
      all the parameters needed for IK/rotation blending.

== How to pose bones using temporary IK ==

Whenever you select two bones with [Pose tool|pose_tool], if
the bones do not already have IK, Houdini will create a temporary IK
solver and end goal to help you pose the bones. Once you deselect the
bones, the temporary goal disappears.

One style of rigging and animating characters is to not assign any
"real" IK solvers to the character at all, and do all posing with
rotates and temporary IK through the Pose tool.
          
== How to squash and stretch bones ==

To squash and stretch the character for cartoon-style animation
anticipation and follow-through, you can do any of the following:

* Change the __Length__ of the bones you want to stretch.

* Parent the bone chain to a control Null and then scale the Null to
  scale the descendant bones.
