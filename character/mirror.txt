    # Before you mirror, check the names of the nodes to make they have
      a consistent prefix (e.g. `L_` for left side) and descriptive
      names (e.g. `R_foot_control`).

    # Select the bones to copy and click the [Icon:SOP/mirror][Mirror|Node:sop/mirror] tool on the __Modify__ tab of the shelf. 

    # In the  [operation controls toolbar|/basics/tools] , set the __New
      prefix__ and __Remove old name up to__ fields to automatically rename the
      nodes as you mirror them and set the __Mirror Plane__.

      For example, if your nodes start with `L_`
      and you want the mirrored nodes to start with `R_`:
