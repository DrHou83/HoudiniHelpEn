== Manually build spines ==

Manually building spines usually involves using the [Path|Node:obj/path] tool.

# In the viewport, press ((Tab)) and type [Path|Node:obj/path].

# Draw the curve in the viewport.

# Make sure the curve is selected, press ((Tab)) in the viewport, and type [Bones from curve|/shelf/bonesfromcurve].

# In the operation controls toolbar, set the __Kinematics__ to __Follow Curve__.

If you move the handles, the bones will follow; however, they will not stretch with the spine. To make a stretchy spine you need to manipulate the length of all the bones with respect to the changing length of the curve. In order to do this you must use the `arclen()` hscript expression pointing to the curve.

=== Making bones stretch with the spine ===

On the __Bone__ tab of one of the bones, use the `arclen()` expression in the __Bone Length__ field. Each bone has to have a length equal to the curve diced up to the number of bones. 

For example, in the following expression the division by fifteen represents one fifteenth of the length of the curve.

`arclen("/obj/path1/output_curve", 0, 0, 1) / 15`
