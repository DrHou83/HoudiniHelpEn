= Create and control bones with a curve =
#parent: buildingrigs

In cases where you want many bones drawn in a clearly defined shape, you
can use the [Bones from Curve tool|/shelf/bonesfromcurve]. You
can assign as many bones as you need and the tool will evenly space and
position them along an existing path curve.

You can also use this tool to set up a "follow curve" solution so you
can use the path curve as a manipulator for the bone chain.

NOTE:
    Manipulating the original curve will alter the shape of the bones.

For more information see the [Bones from Curve|/shelf/bonesfromcurve] help.
