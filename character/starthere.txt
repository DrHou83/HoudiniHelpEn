The most basic way to start is to create a simple tube with bones inside. Once you learn the basic concepts, you will be able to apply them to any model.

# Use the [Icon:SOP/tube][Tube|/shelf/tube] shelf tool to create some tubular shaped geometry.

# Change the __Primitive Type__ to __Polygon__, increase the __Height__ to `8` and the __Rows__ to `10`. You need to have points on your geometry for it to be able to bend. Capture data is stored on points, so you need to have points on your geometry to hold the data.

        The [Icon:OBJ_STATE/bones][Bones|/shelf/bones] shelf tool allows you to interactively draw and manipulate bone chains before animating. The top of the chain of bones has the root, and each bone will be parented to the previous bone. 

        It is important to note that the bones will align to the view you are in. For this example, we will change to the __Front Viewport__ (in the __Set View__ menu) so that everything will line up parallel to the tube walls.
        
# Use the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/bones][Bones|/shelf/bones] shelf tool to draw your bone chain, starting at the root. If this is going to be an arm, you would start from the shoulder point and draw down to the hand. Press ((Enter)) when you are finished drawing your chain.

        In order to link the bones and tube, you must use the [Icon:SOP/capture][Capture Geometry|/shelf/capturegeometry] tool on the shelf.

# Click the [Icon:SOP/capture][Capture Geometry|/shelf/capturegeometry] tool on the __Characters__ shelf, select the geometry objects to capture and press ((Enter)), then select the root object of the capturing hierarchy and press ((Enter)).

        If you switch to __Wireframe__ shading mode you will see that pills are created around the bones, but the are not wide enough to include the geometry. You can edit the diameter of the pills using the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/editcaptureregion][Edit Capture Regions|/shelf/editcaptureregions] tool on the shelf.

# Click the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/editcaptureregion][Edit Capture Regions|/shelf/editcaptureregions] tool on the __Characters__ shelf, select the bone to edit, and drag the arrows to edit the bone capture regions.

        Make sure that the diameter of the pill is wide enough to surround the tube geometry. The geometry will turn the color of the bone once it is captured.

Now when you translate and rotate the bones in the viewport, you will see the geometry move with it. To see the geometry deform in the viewport, you must have the display flag of the [Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/deform] turned on in the tube object.

== Tips ==

* If you turn off the green display flag on your tube object, you can easily select bones in the viewport without accidentally selecting the tube.
                
* You can manually set the pill size on the __Capture__ tab of each bone, instead of using the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/editcaptureregion][Edit Capture Regions|/shelf/editcaptureregions] tool.

* To get bones back to their original pose, you can click ((RMB)) the __Translate__ or __Rotate__ parameters on each bone and select __Revert to Defaults__.
