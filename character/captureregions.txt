=== Capture weights ===

    In Houdini, once you associate skin geometry with bones, each point on
    the skin surface(s) has a [point attribute|Node:sop/attribute]  which stores
    the degree to which the surface is influenced by different bones at that
    point. Where skin covers a joint, the skin can be affected by both bones
    according to percentages.
    
    * To initially associate the skin surface with the character, use the [Capture Geometry tool|/shelf/capturegeometry]. This tool uses Biharmonic capturing, which builds clean weights based on biharmonic functions on tetrahedral meshes.
    
    * You can further edit the volume around each bone that automatically captures
      geometry with the [Edit Capture Region tool|/shelf/editcaptureregions]. 
              
    * You can paint the influence of bones onto surfaces with the [Paint capture weights tool|/shelf/paintcapturelayer].
    
    * You can view the capture weight attributes on the surface numerically with the  [details view|/ref/panes/geosheet].

        
== Posing the character for capture ==

Houdini uses a character's _capture pose_ when it binds geometry by
proximity to the bones. The capture pose does not have to be the same as
the character rigging rest pose. You can pose the character specifically
for capturing geometry, based on the position of the skin model.

steps>>
    # Choose __Edit > Objects > Bone Kinematics Override: Capture
      Pose__.

    # [Pose the character|/shelf/pose] to match the model geometry.

    # To return to normal posing, choose __Edit > Objects > Bone
      Kinematics Override: None__.

TIP:
    This submenu also lets you edit the "rest" pose that controls IK the
    solution. See [how to edit the rest position|restangles].


== Paint capture weights ==

See [Paint Capture Layer|/shelf/paintcapturelayer] shelf help.

== Detail Attributes ==

If you are using the Auto Rig you will not have to deal with detail attributes. However, if you are building your own character the following capture attributes are stored in detail attributes.

boneCapture:
    Output by the [Bone apture|Node:sop/capture] and [Bone Capture Proximity|Node:sop/captureproximity] SOPs, stores the point weighting information. It consists of pairs of the capture region attribute along with its associated weight.
    
pCaptAlpha:
    Output by the [Capture Layer Paint SOP|Node:sop/capturelayerpaint], contains the painted alpha information.
    
pCaptFrame:
    Output by the [Bone Capture|Node:sop/capture] and [Bone Capture Proximity|Node:sop/captureproximity] SOPs, contains the rest frame at which the data was captured.
    
pCaptSkelRoot:
    Output by the [Bone Capture|Node:sop/capture] and [Bone Capture Proximity|Node:sop/captureproximity] SOPs, contains the parent path of all capture regions.
