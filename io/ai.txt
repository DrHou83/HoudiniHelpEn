= Reading Adobe Illustrator(tm) and EPS files =

#bestbet: ai eps

== Overview ==

EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) is an interchange file format
for PostScript 2D vector illustration data.

`.ai` files are the native file format of Adobe Illustrator.
Technically they are annotated EPS files.

EPS file import uses an external utility program
(`geps`) to convert the `.ai` or `.eps` file to a Houdini
geometry file in the same directory and then uses a
[File node|Node:sop/file] to load the converted file.

== Importing AI and EPS files ==

- Use __File > Import > Geometry__ to create a new object from
  the imported file.

- Inside a geometry object, a [File node|Node:sop/file] can
  import the geometry from the file into the object.

== Limitations ==

- Only imports path data. Convert text to paths before saving.
- Currently only works with _uncompressed_ AI files. Turn off
  compression before saving.
- Currently will not import open curves.
