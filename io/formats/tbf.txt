= Tile block formats =

File types such as .rat textures, deep shadow maps, IPR files, and point clouds use a tile block format which is optimized to use less memory. Tile block format files only load portions of the file to RAM, which makes it possible to use extremely large data sets while using minimal memory. Also, since the cache is shared between geometry (point clouds) and images (textures, DSM, IPR etc.), efficient caching of data can be performed.
