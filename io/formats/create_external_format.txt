= Write a custom importer/exporter =

If you have a format that you would like to be able to read and/or
write, you can write a converter from your file format to the equivalent
native Houdini format and/or a converter from the equivalent native
format to your format. Then, add an entry to the appropriate IO table in
$HFS/houdini/support. The converter program can appear anywhere in the
Houdini search path.

    tr>>
        th>> Data type
        th>> Intermediate format
        th>> I/O table
    tr>>

            `.clip`

        td>> Image
        td>> Any supported image format

NOTE:
    You should generally not modify files in $HFS/houdini. Copy the
    files under $HOME/houdini and modify them there.

Each line of an I/O table file contains the filename suffix, the command
to read the custom format (in quotes), and the command to write the
custom format (in quotes). Use `%s` to represent the filename in the
quoted commands.

Future formats will be added using this method.
