= .d (draw) format =

The `.d` format is a seldom-used ASCII polygon file format which is
simpler than the `.poly` format as it only has only two sections: POINTS
and POLYS. The `.d` format has only moves and draws, where a move
signifies the beginning of a new polygon.

The `.d` format is suitable for user-written programs that create
polygon information if you do not want to use the Houdini polygon
library. It can describe 2D or 3D lines and supports comments.

== Syntax ==

    * The standard syntax for a `.d` file is a set of commands.

    * `.d` files have one command per line.

    * The character in the first column (`m` or `d`) specifies the
      command (move or draw). Commands are followed by white space, then
      a list of arguments delimited by whitespace.

    * Whitespace is any combination of tabs and space characters.

    * The arguments are floating point numbers.
