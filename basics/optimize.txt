== Speed up drawing and tumbling ==

You can use controls on the [display options window|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d]'s __Optimization__ tab to draw lower fidelity scenes to improve interactivity on extremely large scenes.

:task:Show the view optimization controls:
    # Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/displayoptions] Display Options button to the right of the view, or press ((D)) in the view.
        
    # Click the __Optimization__ tab.

:task:Change the shading mode:
    Houdini has several "shading modes" (methods for drawing the scene in the viewer), including only showing bounding boxes.

    See the [section on viewing|view] for more information.

:task:Set up Houdini to use a simpler shading mode while tumbling:
    # In the display options window, click the __Optimization__ tab,
      click the __Interactivity__ sub-tab.

    # Turn on __Interactive mode__ and choose the shading mode to
      use while tumbling.

    # Set the __Render time__. If Houdini takes longer than this
      number of milliseconds to redraw the view, it will switch to
      the simpler shading mode. This lets you only use the simpler
      shading mode when view redraw is actually slow.

      Set this to 0 to always use the simpler mode when changing the
      view.

:task:Draw hulls instead of surfaces:
    # In the display options window, click the __Guides & Markers__
      tab. Turn on the display of primitive hulls.

    # Click the __Optimization__ tab, then click the __Culling__
      sub-tab.

    # Turn on __Display hulls only__.

:task:Don't draw back-facing polygons:
    * In the display options window, click the __Optimization__ tab,
      click the __Culling__ sub-tab and turn on __Remove
      backfaces__.

      This prevents Houdini from drawing any polygons that face away
      from the camera. This is a useful optimization if you already
      have airtight models, but it can make modeling harder.

:task:Limit the amount of geometry Houdini draws:
    # In the display options window, click the __Optimization__ tab,
      click the __Culling__ sub-tab.

    # Use the __Display geometry of type__ pop-up menu to display
      all geometry or only display a certain type of geometry. You
      can use this to eliminate the display of geometry types you
      aren't interested in right now, speeding up the display.

    # Use the __cull by drawing primitives out of every__ option to
      only draw a certain percentage of all the geometry in the
      scene. This is mostly useful for decimating polygonal models
      to speed up the display.
          
== Speed up cooking ==

- [Lock nodes|/model/lock_nodes] to cache the results of the upstream nodes wherever the node's output does not change.

- [Profile the network|/ref/panes/perfmon] to find out which nodes take the longest to cook and see if you can accomplish the same thing in a more efficient way.
