== Requirements ==

Houdini for OS X will only run on Macs running OS X 10.8 or later.

== Differences ==

=== Menu bar ===
#display: pull left

The menu bar on OS X isn't part of the main Houdini window. It is integrated into the desktop title bar like other Mac applications.

=== Install location ===
#display: pull left

By default, Houdini installs in a `HoudiniX.X.XXX` folder inside of a `Houdini` folder located inside the Applications folder. You can launch the applications from within the Houdini X.X.XXX folder or you can drag the icons into the OS X Dock for easy access.

=== Keys ===
#display: pull left

Most hotkeys that use ((Ctrl)) on Windows instead use ((Cmd)) on Mac.

The meaning of the ((Backspace)) (large Delete key) and ((Del)) keys are swapped from their mappings on Windows.
