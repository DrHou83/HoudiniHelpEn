#bestbet: take takes


== Overview ==

_Takes_ are hierarchically overlayed sets of parameter changes. They let you create chains of overlayed changes, or alternatives, and quickly switch between them.

Any parameters you don't explicitly change in a take are inherited from the parent take. You can create a take and within that take change some parameters, then create a parallel take with different changes. Both takes will inherit the values in their parent takes.

Takes are useful for:

* Exploring alternative designs with the ability to switch back and forth to compare the alternatives.

* Layering tweaks or explorations on top of a "known good" or approved shot/design. You can see which parameters you've changed and easily return to, copy-paste from, etc., the original scene.

* Holding different sets of parameters for different render passes. You can use the __Render with take__ parameter on render nodes to control which take to use when you render.

Parameters not included in the current take appear disabled in the parameter editor unless you turn on [Auto-take mode|#autotakes].


== Example ==

You start with the "Main" take. You might start working on a [pyro effect|/pyro/pyro] and create a `tweaks_1` take to hold your initial explorations:

{{{
Main
    tweaks_1
}}}

When you get to an effect you like, you can start a new take `tweaks_2` as a sub-take of `tweaks_1` to build off it. This acts as a "checkpoint" that lets you easily go back and forth between `tweaks_1` and `tweaks_2`.

{{{
Main
    tweaks_1
        tweaks_2
}}}


== How to ==

You can use the controls in the top right corner of the main interface
to quickly switch between and create takes. For more involved editing, you can use the [take list pane|#pane].

:platform:Mac:
    On Mac, Houdini has a __Takes__ menu in the main menus instead of a pop-up in the main window.

:task:Create a new take:
    Open the take list pop-up menu and choose __New Take__.

:task:Choose the current take:
    Open the take list pop-up menu and choose a take.

:task:Add a parameter to a take:
    Right click the parameter and choose __Include in Take__.
        
:task:See which parameters are included in a take:
    In the take list pane, click the take on the left side to see
    its contents on the right side. (If the take list is not
    divided into left and right sub-panes, click the __Show
    contents__ checkbox in the toolbar.)

:task:Add all of a node's parameters to a take:
    Drag the node's tile from the network pane onto the take in
    the take list.

:task:Remove a parameter from a take:
    Press ((RMB)) on the parameter name (in a parameter editor or
    the right side of the take pane) and choose __Exclude from Take__.

:task:Add the state of a node flag to the current take:
    Right click the node and choose __Take Toggle <<flag name>>__.


== Auto-takes == (autotakes)

By default, you must explicitly add parameters you want to change to a take. This helps keep takes "clean".

However, you can turn on [auto takes|#autotakes] to enable all parameters and automatically add any changes you make to the current take. This obviously can be more convenient in certain situations, however you should try to avoid using Auto-take mode too much. It makes it easy for you to unintentionally include parameters and override parent takes, which in turn can make diagnosing problems difficult when takes don't behave the way you expect.

:task:Turn on automatic adding of parameters to takes:
    Open the take list pop-up menu (or __Takes__ menu on the Mac) and turn on Auto-takes.
    
    An [Icon:BUTTONS/auto] "Auto" icon appears in the pop-up menu when auto-takes is on.

:task:Assign a hotkey to the auto-take toggle:
    ((Ctrl + Alt + Shift)) click the menu item.


== Take list pane == (pane)

The full Take list pane/window lets you rename, rearrange, and delete
takes as well as create and select them.

Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/new_tab] Add Tab button in a pane and choose
__Take list__ to add a new tab with a take list, or choose
__Windows > Take Manager__ to create a take list in a floating window.

:task:Create a new take:
    In the take list pane, click __Add Take__.

:task:Create a new take as a child of an existing take:
    Press ((RMB)) on a take and choose __Append Take__.

:task:Insert a new take between an existing parent and its children:
    Press ((RMB)) on a take and choose __Insert Take__.

:task:Choose the current take:
    Click the take in the take list, or choose it from the
    __Take__ pop-up menu in the main menu bar.

:task:Rename a take:
    Double-click the take and type the new name.

:task:Merge takes:
    # Drag and drop the first take onto the target take you want to
      merge it with.

    # Choose how the merge will handle cases where the same
      parameter is in both takes.

:task:Move a take under a new parent:
    Drag and drop the take onto its new parent, then click __Move
    take here__.

:task:Remove a take from the hierarchy:
    Press ((RMB)) on the take and choose __Delete Take__. The
    children of the deleted take will become children of the
    deleted take's parent.

:task:Delete a take and all its children:
    Press ((RMB)) on the take and choose __Delete Take (and
    children)__.


== Tips and tricks ==

* You don't have to worry about giving takes descriptive names as you create them. When you select a take in the takes pane, it displays which parameters are changed in the take.

* You might want to start by creating an "empty" `defaults` take, and do your work in sub-takes of `defaults`. This lets you switch to the `defaults` take to quickly check the default values of parameters.
