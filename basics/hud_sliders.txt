== Overview ==

The [parameter editor|/network/parms] lets you edit the parameters of the selected node to change how it works. However, sometimes there is a set of parameters that you want constant and easy access to. For example:

* Parameters are on a deeply nested node that's time consuming to navigate to.

* You are constantly tweaking parameters from two different nodes and don't want to switch back and forth between them.

* You want to put some useful parameters from a character in the view so you can access them even with the view maximized and the parameter editor hidden.

_HUD_ (Heads Up Display) sliders appear in the viewer and controls a parameter on a node. They can stay visible when the parameter's node is not selected. You can group sliders together, move them around the view, and choose when they're visible.

== How to ==

TIP:
    HUD sliders are disabled when you use some Houdini tools such as View. If your HUD sliders appear dimmed, switch to another tool to re-enable the HUD sliders.

:task:Create a HUD slider:
    Drag a parameter from the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] into the viewer, then click __HUD Slider__.

    After you create the slider you can optionally move and resize it (see below). 

:task:Remove a HUD slider:
    Right-click the slider and turn off the __Persistent__ checkbox.

:task:Edit a slider's range:
    # Right-click the slider and choose __Handle Parameters__.
    
    # Enter the values for the low end and high end of the slider.
    
    # If you want to prevent the value from being dragged out of the range, turn on __Lock Low__ and/or __Lock High__.

:task:Switch between positioning/resizing sliders and using them:
    * To make a slider movable/resizable, right-click it and turn off __Locked__.
    
    * To make the slider usable again, right-click it and turn on __Locked__.

:task:Position and resize a slider:
    Unlock the slider so it's movable/resizable (see above). To move the slider, drag the slider bar. To resize the slider, drag the right edge of the slider box.

:task:Dock sliders together to move/resize them as a group:
    Drag a slider next to another slider or group of similar size. The slider will automatically dock itself with the other slider(s).

:task:Break up docked sliders:
    Right-click the slider you want to ungroup and turn off __Docked__.
