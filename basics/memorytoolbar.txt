#bestbet: memory

== Overview ==

The _memory toolbar_ can save and restore different aspects of the 3D view:

* It can bookmark and restore different viewing positions.

    This might be useful if you want to switch back and forth between different viewpoints but don't want to add camera objects to the scene for some reason.

* It can snapshot the current view and switch between the real view and snapshot images.

    This can be useful to compare the before and after of a parameter change.

* It can save and restore different construction planes.

NOTE:
    The [render view|/ref/views/ipr] has a similar toolbar for snapshotting renders and comparing them to the current render.

TIP:
    This toolbar has an outdated user interface and is hidden by default, but it might still be useful in certain circumstances.

== How to ==

:task: Show the memory toolbar:
    The memory toolbar is hidden by default. To show it, click the view menu in the top right corner of the viewport, and turn on __Memory Toolbar__.
