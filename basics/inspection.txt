= Inspection mode =

== Overview ==

You can turn on [Icon:TOOLS/inspect] Inspection mode in the toolbox to the left of the 3D view. When Inspection mode is on, Houdini shows a small window with information about what's under the mouse pointer.

Inspection mode works in the 3D view (for object and geometry networks), the render view, and the compositing view.

== Tips ==

* You can choose what information Houdini shows using options on the icon's right-click menu.

* Inspection mode can be useful in the render view to find out what object generated certain pixels in the render.

* Houdini temporarily hides the information window when you switch to the [Icon:TOOLS/view] View tool (for example, by holding ((Space))).

* If the inspection tool is too slow, try turning off __Magnify Area Under Cursor__ in the options.
