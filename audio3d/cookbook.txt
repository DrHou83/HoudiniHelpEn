== Simple Effects ==

    These simple effects are quick to render and easy to use. The
    advanced effects, listed in the next section, take longer to cook
    and more effort to setup. All of these effects are optional. If all
    effects are off, the Spatial Audio chop behaves like a regular
    mixer.

    == Distance Delay and the Doppler Effect ==

        Sound does not travel instantly, so distant sounds have a
        noticeable delay. This delay also causes the Doppler effect,
        which is the shifting of pitch as a sound source rapidly passes
        a listener (e.g. the pitch of an ambulance's siren lowers as it
        passes).

        The amount of delay is determined by the speed that sound
        travels. Usually you will be using the speed of 331 m/s, which
        is the speed of sound in air (at zero degrees Celsius, but room
        temperature is very close to this also). Another useful speed to
        know is 1452 m/s - the speed of sound in water (at 15 degrees
        Celsius). The speed of sound is defined in the [Spatial Audio
        CHOP|Node:chop/spatial]'s 'Speed of Sound' parameter in the
        Environment page.

        If you want to exaggerate the delay or the Doppler effect, lower
        the speed of sound from its realistic value. A speed of 166 m/s
        will double the delay and the Doppler shift in air.

    == Volume Loss over Distance ==

        Sound also loses intensity as it travels. The [Spatial Audio
        CHOP|Node:chop/spatial] supports two methods for determining the
        volume loss at any distance.

        == Using Realistic Drop-off ==

            This method is the easiest to set up, and produces a
            realistic result. It is based on a physics equation,
            `$$power = 1/[distance^2]$$`.
            
            To change how fast this drop-off occurs,
            you can modify the '10m Distance Loss' parameter on the
            [Spatial Audio CHOP|Node:chop/spatial]'s Effects page. This
            parameter specifies the amount of sound intensity loss after
            traveling 10 meters. A value of 0.4 means that the sound
            will loss 40% of its intensity after 10 meters (because of
            the drop-off curve, after 20 meters the sound loss will be
            at 85%).

        == Using a Drop-off Table ==

            This method requires you to create a curve that represents
            the drop-off of the sound as it travels farther. This curve
            can be created with another CHOP and passed to [Spatial
            Audio CHOP|Node:chop/spatial] by connecting it to its first
            input.

            The Volume Lookup Range parameter determines the range of
            distances that this curve describes. If this parameter is
            set to (5, 100), then the first value of the curve will be
            the volume level at 5 meters, and the last value of the
            curve will be the volume at 100 meters. Anything outside the
            lookup range will be sampled in the curve's extend regions.

            This method is a little more work to setup, but allows you
            to create any kind of drop-off, even completely unrealistic
            ones.

    == Echoes ==

        Echoes and environmental reverb can be produced with very little
        effort. The [Spatial Audio CHOP|Node:chop/spatial] supports two
        types of echoes; static environment echoes and dynamic echoes.
        Static environment echoes are a good choice for enclosed areas,
        while dynamic echoes simulate open areas well.

        Both echo methods allow you to specify the number of echoes, the
        echo delay (or the minimum echo delay), and the echo volume.

        The echo drop-off is determined by the same drop-off method as
        normal sounds. If the sound delay is 0.1 seconds, and the speed
        of sound is 331m/s, the echo travels 33 meters farther than the
        original sound, so the volume drops according. Each echo has the
        same delay from the previous echo (so the 4th echo arrives 0.4
        seconds after the original sound if the echo delay is 0.1
        seconds).

        If you find the echoes are too subtle, increase the Echo Volume
        parameter.

        == Using Static Environment Echoes ==

            Static echoes always have the same delay between echoes,
            regardless of the distance between the source and the
            listener.

        == Using Dynamic Echoes ==

            Dynamic echoes base their echo delay on how far the original
            sound traveled. Distant sounds will have longer pauses
            between the echoes and close sounds will have almost no echo
            delay.

            The 'Dynamic Echo Effect' parameter determines the portion
            of the traveling delay that is used as the echo delay. So,
            if the Dynamic Echo Effect is set to 0.3, and the sound
            traveled 4 seconds to reach the listener, the echo delay
            will be 1.2 seconds (0.3x4).

            To ensure a minimum echo delay, set the 'Echo Delay'
            parameter to a non-zero value. This will add a static echo
            delay to the dynamic echo delay. So an Echo Delay of 0.1,
            Dynamic Echo Effect of 0.3 and a traveling time of 4 seconds
            would produce an echo delay of 1.3 seconds (0.3 * 4 + 0.1).

== Advanced Effects ==

    These effects require  [filters|filters] . While most of the
    simple effects are done by the Spatial Audio CHOP, these effects
    require other objects and CHOPs, so they take slightly longer to set
    up.

    == Obstacle Occlusion ==

        This effect allows you to create geometry object and use them to
        block sound. "Blocked" sound can be completely blocked,
        partially blocked or even amplified. A filter is used to
        describe which frequencies are blocked by the object, and by how
        much.

        == Setting up an Object for 3D Audio ==

            Any geometry can be used as an obstacle. Most obstacles
            should be fairly low resolution geometry, since increasing
            the resolution has little effect on the overall audible
            result.

            Each obstacle needs a Sound Material associated with it, to
            describe how it affects the sound passing through it. If the
            Sound Material includes a transmission filter, the filter is
            used to filter the sound directly. Otherwise, the absorption
            or reflection filter is used (but inverted to determine the
            transmission filter). See the next section, Designing a
            Filter, for details on filters.

            To add the geometry as an obstacle to the [Spatial Audio
            CHOP|Node:chop/spatial], turn on __Check For Obstacles__ on
            the __Effects__ tab. Then add the geometry object to the
            parameter 'Obstacles' (using the pull-down menu). Objects
            without Sound Materials will be ignored.

        == Tweaking the Occlusion Effect ==

            The parameter 'Obstacle Softness' determines how soft the
            obstacle is. Soft obstacles allow quite a lot of sound
            around them, while hard obstacles do not (softness of zero).
            Two of the main factors that affect how much sound get by
            the obstacle are:

            how far both the sound source and the microphone are from
            the obstacle (more sound gets around the obstacle at longer
            distances)

            the size of the obstacle (larger objects allow less sound
            around them)

            So, an object between a sound source and the microphone that
            are close together will block most of the sound, while the
            same object roughly in the middle of a widely separated
            source source and microphone will have little effect. A
            larger object will always have more of an effect than a
            smaller one in the same situation.

            If you don't want any sound to get around the obstacles, set
            the obstacle softness to zero.

    == Microphone Filters ==

        Each microphone listens to the full spectrum by default.
        However, you can setup a microphone to only listen to a certain
        parts of the spectrum. This allows you to create microphones
        which create sub-woofer tracks, high frequency tracks, or
        mid-range tracks. This effect is created by adding a filter to a
        Microphone Object.

        The Microphone object has a __Filter__ parameter on its
        Microphone page which references a filter. The filter should be
        created by an Acoustic CHOP, and it should be an Absorption
        filter ("absorb").

    == The Echo Filter ==

        The echo filter is an optional filter that is applied to each
        echo. This allows you to change the sound characteristics of the
        echo.

        The [Spatial Audio CHOP|Node:chop/spatial] must be generating
        echoes for this filter to have any effect. To add an echo
        filter, connect the CHOP containing the filter to the third
        input (the 'Echo Filter' input).

        The filter is applied more than once to higher numbered echoes.
        The first echo has the filter applied to it once, the second has
        the filter applied to it twice, the third three times, and so
        on. Because of this, you should not make the filter block sound
        too drastically (with values close to 0).

    == The Environment Filter ==

        The environment filter is an optional filter applied to all
        sounds. The effect of the filter varies with distance, exactly
        like 'Volume Loss over Distance'. It uses the same method to
        calculate the volume loss. The filter is multiplied by the
        calculated volume loss and applied to the sound.

        When designing an environment filter, you can use either a
        transmission or absorption filter to describe the volume loss.
        You should not make the losses too large (not more than 0.5),
        otherwise sounds will lose most of their intensity over a very
        short distance.

        To add an environment filter, connect the CHOP containing the
        filter to the [Spatial Audio CHOP|Node:chop/spatial]'s second
        input (the "Environment Filter" input).
