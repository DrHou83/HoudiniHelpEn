== Overview ==

The 3D Spatial Audio system in Houdini integrates 3D animation and
geometry with sound effects. You can animate sound sources and
microphones in your scene to create realistic environmental audio.

Environmental audio uses several components to integrate audio with
scene elements.

[Sound object|Node:obj/sound] :
    Creates virtual audio in the scene. It uses the first channel of a
    CHOP which contains the actual audio data. It has a position, an
    orientation, volume controls, and projection cones.
[Acoustic CHOP|Node:chop/acoustic] :
    You can use this to create  [filters|filters] .
[Microphone object|Node:obj/microphone] :
    A positional listening point. This object defines the position,
    orientation, sensitivity and listening cones for "recording" virtual
    audio in the scene.
Geometry:
    You can use geometry as obstacles to block sound. The geometry must
    have a sound material (a set of filters created with the [Acoustic
    CHOP|Node:chop/acoustic]) associated with it. Sound obstacles should
    be lightweight geometry.
[Spatial audio CHOP|Node:chop/spatial] :
    The Spatial Audio CHOP is the central hub for all audio components
    and the "rendering engine" of the 3D audio system. The Spatial Audio
    CHOP:

    * References all microphones to be rendered in the Microphone
      parameter. Microphones can reference an optional filter, created
      with an Acoustic chop.

    * References all sound objects to be rendered in the Sound Sources
      parameter.

    * References any geometry objects to be used as obstacles. These
      geometry objects must reference a Sound Material, a CHOP
      containing a filter designed by an Acoustic CHOP.

The basic 3D audio setup is a [Sound object|Node:obj/sound], a
[Microphone object|Node:obj/microphone], and a [Spatial audio
CHOP|Node:chop/spatial]. The Sound object requires a CHOP containing the
audio to project (usually a [File CHOP|Node:chop/file] loading an audio
file).

You can use any number of microphones and sound sources. Each microphone
produces an audio track which is mixed into the Spatial Audio CHOP.

== How to set up a 3D audio animation ==

steps>>
    # In a  [network editor pane|/ref/panes/network] , switch
      to the CHOP network and  [create a File CHOP|/basics/tools]  to load
      the audio for a sound source.

    # Switch to the Object network and create a Sound object.

    # TBD.

NOTE:
    The spatial audio system's acoustical model is based on the
    real-world scale of your scene. Its default is one Houdini unit =
    one meter. If your scene is modeled at a different scale, change the
    __Meters Per Unit__ parameter on the [Spatial Audio
    CHOP|Node:chop/spatial]'s __Environment__ tab.
