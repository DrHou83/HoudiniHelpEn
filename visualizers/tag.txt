"""Displays a selectable label pointing to an object, even when the object is offscreen."""

This can be useful for annotating objects in the scene for artists, or making large selection targets for small, hard to select, or far-off objects.

See [visualizers|/basics/visualizers] for more information.

@parameters

== Contents ==

Style:
    Whether the tag contains text, an icon, or both.

Text source:
    Where to get the tag text. You can use the object name, a fixed string, or the value of a detail attribute from the object's geometry.

Icon source:
    Where to get the tag icon. You can use the object's icon or choose an image file.


== Behavior ==

Preferred placement:
    Where to put the tag when all sides are available. If there's no room in the viewport to use this side, Houdini will automatically display it on a different side.

Clicking tag selects object:
    Clicking the tag will select the object. Turn this off to make the tag unclickable.


=== When object is offscreen ===

Keep tag in viewport:
    Display the tag even when the object is not in view. This is useful for selecting objects in the viewport when they're not visible.

Show icon only:
    When an object is not in view but the tag is displayed, only show the icon. This helps reduce tag clutter. (How to tell what object tag is for???)


== Appearance ==

Font:
    Font for the tag text.

Font size:
    Size of the tag text.

Icon size:
    Size of the tag icon.

Text color:
    Color for the tag text.

Frame tagged object:
    Show a frame around the object in addition to the tag.

Frame color:
    Color for the frame around the object.
