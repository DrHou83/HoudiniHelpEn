= Manipulating asset internals =

* The [hotl|/ref/utils/hotl] command line utility takes the name of an OTL file and prints information about the operators defined in the OTL. This is the same information that appears when you press ((MMB)) on a node.

    It can also expand the files contained inside an `.hda` file, and collapse expanded files back into an `.hda` file. This may be useful for programmatically or batch editing files inside assets.

* The VEX compiler `vcc` can generate an asset library file from a `.vfl` file.

    {{{
    #!sh
    vcc -l shaders.hda shader.vfl
    }}}
    
    This compiles `shader.vfl`, and puts the generated dialog script file, `.vex` file, and the uncompiled `.vfl` file into `shaders.hda`. You can also specifyan icon, name, and label for your shader. You can edit the `.vfl` file in the new asset's type properties window.
