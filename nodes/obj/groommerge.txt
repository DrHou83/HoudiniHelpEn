= Groom Merge =

"""Merges groom data from multiple objects into one."""

This node allows you to set up a groom using multiple separate guide grooms, and then merge them into a single stream for deformation, simulation, and rendering.

@parameters

== General ==

Groom Objects:
    #id: sourcegroomobjects
    The list of groom objects for to merge.

Groom File:
    #id: sourcegroomfile

    Load the groom data from this file.


Isolate Groom Objects:
    #id: isolategroomobjects

    When any objects are listed here, only those objects will be merged.

    This can be used to work on a small part of the groom.

    TIP:
	    A quick way of isolating parts of a groom is the [Isolate Groom Parts|/shelf/groom_isolateparts] shelf tool. It uses this parameter, but in addition also sets display flags on subsequent hair generate objects.


Additional Skin SOPs: 
    #id: skinsops

    In addition to the merged groom objects, merge attributes from these skin geometries.

== Guides ==

Create Groups:
    #id: creategroups

    Create a group for the guides of each merged groom object. The name of
    the groom object is used as the group name.

Create Name Attribute:
    #id: createguidenameattrib

    Create a primitive name attribute and set it to each guide's source groom
    object.

Name Attribute:
    #id: guidenameattrib

    The name of the name attribute.

Create Path Attribute:
    #id: createguidepathattrib

    Create a primitive attribute and set it to each guide's source groom object
    path.

Path Attribute:
    #id: guidepathattrib

    The name of the path attribute.

Reset Primitive IDs:
    #id: reseteids

    Sets the primitive `id` attribute to each primitive's new number.

    This fixes overlapping ids, when merging multiple grooms that all have
    IDs starting from `0`.

Point Attributes:
    #id: guidepointattribs

    List of guide point attributes to keep.

Vertex Attributes:
    #id: guidevertexattribs

    List of guide vertex attributes to keep.

Primitive Attributes:
    #id: guideprimattribs

    List of guide primitives attributes to keep.

Detail Attributes:
    #id: guidedetailattribs

    List of guide detail attributes to keep.

== Skin ==

Point Attributes:
    #id: skinpointattribs

    List of skin attributes to keep.

    Attributes that exist on multiple skin geometries are combined
    using the max attribute. This (only) works well for mask attributes.
