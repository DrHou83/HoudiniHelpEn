"""A male character with motion captured animations."""

This asset is a male character with various animation mocap cycles including walk, run, wait, standing, zombie, and rest. It has 4 variations on clothing and 10 different textures. You can also supply your own custom texture.

This asset is designed for mid to distance shots or pre-visualization work where an animated character is required.

Mocap Biped 1 and [Mocap Biped 2|Node:obj/mocapbiped2] have different textures and animations. You can use them to test variation in a crowd scene.

Biped 1 has animation on the bones and Biped 2 has animation on nulls (since it was imported from an FBX file).
