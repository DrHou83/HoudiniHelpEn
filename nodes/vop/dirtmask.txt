= Dirt Mask =

"""Masks crevices or exposed edges"""

When the unmodified surface normal, will find crevices. If the negated normal is connected, will find exposed edges.
@parameters

Sampling Mode:
    #id: mode
    Hemisphere:
	Samples in a dome around the shaded point. The dirt mask is computed using the percentage of rays that hit a surface.

    Fan:
	Samples in a fan around the surface normal, with __Sensitivity__ controlling the ray direction. Lower sensitivity values rotate the rays towards the surface normal.

	The mask is computed based on the farthest surface hit by any ray.

Sensitivity:
    #id: sensitivity

    In __Fan Sampling Mode__, this controls the ray direction. Lower sensitivity values rotate the rays towards the surface normal, making it less likely that neighbouring surface points are hit.

Samples:
    #id: samples
    The number of samples to take.

Maximum Distance:
    #id: maxdist
    The maximum distance to cast rays.

    Modulate this using a noise function to create dirty areas of varying size and shape.

Bias Direction:
    #id: biasdir
    A direction in which to bias rays. For example, this can be used to simulate more dirt accumulating on the underside of an object.

Bias:
    #id: bias
    The amount to bias rays in the __Bias Direction__

Scope:
    #id: scope
    This can be used to limit the set of objects to cast rays against.

@inputs

P:
    The surface position from which rays are cast.

nN:
    The surface normal. This can be inverted to mask exposed edges rather than crevices.
