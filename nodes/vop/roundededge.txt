= Rounded Edge =

"""Blends the normals between faces within specified radius."""

This operator sends rays against nearby surfaces to blend the shading normals between faces. This can be useful to fake beveled edges on hard surfaces.

@inputs

Mode:
    Types of edges (concave or convex) to smooth.

Samples:
    Number of directions to trace.

Radius:
    Rounding radius, in Houdini units.

Cusp Angle:
    If the angle between the current shading normal and the normal of sampled surface is below this threshold (in degrees), it won't be blended together. 

nN:
    Normalized input normal. Uses global N if unconnected.

Object Scope:
    List of object names to trace against. Used to blend normals only against specific objects.

@outputs

No:
    Normalized result.

mo:
    Affected mask. Gives 1 if the normals are changed. 0 if normals are unchanged.
