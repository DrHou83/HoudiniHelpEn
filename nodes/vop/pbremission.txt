= PBR Emission =

"""Makes a shaded surface emissive."""

This node adds emissive light effects to an object. It can be combined with other BSDF shading VOPs by plugging them into its base layer input.

@parameters

Color:
    #id: color
    The emission color.

Intensity:
    #id: intensity
    The emission intensity. High values may be required here when using the shader to illuminate other objects.

Illuminate Objects:
    #id: illum
    Causes emissive light to appear in secondary light bounces.

    NOTE:
	For this effect to appear in diffuse lighting, __Diffuse Limit__ limit must be set to a value of at least `1` on the [Icon:ROP/mantra][Mantra ROP|Node:out/ifd]

Shade Both Sides As Front:
    #id: frontface
    Shades both sides as if they are the front. The back side has no emission when this is disabled.
