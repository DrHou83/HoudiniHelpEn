= Skin Shader Core =

"""A skin shader with three levels of subsurface scattering."""

@parameters

== Diffuse ==

Color:
    #id: diffusecolor

    The skin's diffuse color.

== Subsurface Scattering ==

Amount:
    #id: sss

    The amount of subsurface scattering to perform. This blends linearly between
    pure diffuse shading and subsurface scattering.

    NOTE:
	Subsurface scattering with a very low distance setting looks very
	similar to diffuse shading, making it possible to achieve good blending
	just by varying (texturing) the distance or color values.

	However, this parameter may be a more convenient way of masking off
	scattering areas.

Distance Multiplier:
    #id: sssdistmult

    Multiplies the scattering distances of the individual components below.

== Shallow Layer ==

    Subsurface scattering layer for shallow features.

Color:
    #id: shallowcolor

    The color of this scattering layer.

Scattering Distance:
    #id: shallowdist

    The scattering distance of this layer.

Weight:
    #id: shallowweight

    The weight of this layer. The component weights of all layers are added and
    normalized.

== Medium Layer ==

Color:
    #id: mediumcolor

    The color of this scattering layer.

Scattering Distance:
    #id: mediumdist

    The scattering distance of this layer.

Weight:
    #id: mediumweight

    The weight of this layer. The component weights of all layers are added and
    normalized.

== Deep Layer ==

Color:
    #id: deepcolor

    The color of this scattering layer.

Scattering Distance:
    #id: deepdist

    The scattering distance of this layer.

Weight:
    #id: deepweight

    The weight of this layer. The component weights of all layers are added and
    normalized.

== Primary Reflection ==

Reflectivity:
    #id: refl1

    Intensity of the primary reflection layer.

Roughness:
    #id: reflrough1

    Roughness of the primary reflection layer.

== Secondary Reflection ==

Reflectivity:
    #id: refl2

    Intensity of the secondary reflection layer.

Roughness:
    #id: reflrough2

    Roughness of the secondary reflection layer.
