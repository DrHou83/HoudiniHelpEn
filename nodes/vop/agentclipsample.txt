= Agent Clip Sample =

"""Samples an agent's animation clip at a specific time."""

Evaluates the clip at the given time and returns either the local or world transforms of the agent's rig, or the value of a specific channel.
Returns an empty array if the clip name is not one of the agent's [animation clips|Node:vop/agentclipcatalog], the primitive number is out of range, the primitive is not an agent, or the transform index is [out of range|Vex:agenttransformcount].

@parameters

Signature:
    Specifies whether to sample a specific transform, all of the agent's transforms, or the value of a specific channel.
    
Geometry File:
    The geometry to fetch the agent primitives from. The `op:/` syntax can be
    used to refer to a SOP operator rather than a file on disk.

Primitive Number:
    The primitive number of the agent primitive.

Clip Name:
    The name of the animation clip.

Clip Time:
    The time (in seconds) to evaluate the clip at. If this time is greater than the [clip's length|Node:vop/agentcliplength], it will be wrapped around.

Transform Index:
    Index of a transform in the agent's rig if __Signature__ is `Matrix4`.

Channel Name:
    Name of a channel in the animation clip if __Signature__ is `Float`.

Space:
    Specifies whether to return the transforms in local space or world space if __Signature__ is `Matrix4` or `Matrix4 Array`.
