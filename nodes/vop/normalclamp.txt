= Normal Clamp =

"""Clamp shading normals to prevent bad reflection directions"""

Clamps the input shading normal in a way that reflection vector of the
input incident direction (assuming perfect specular) lies on the same side
as geometry normal. This VOP can be used to avoid shading artifacts at
grazing angles particularly when bump or normal maps are used.


@inputs

Shading Normal:
    Normalized shading normal.

Geometry Normal:
    Normalized geometry normal.

Incident Direction:
    Normalized direction from eye to shading point.

Bias:
    Effectively increases detection threshold. If bias is set too high,
    reflections near grazing angles may appear incorrect.


@outputs

outN:
    The clamped shading normal (normalized).
