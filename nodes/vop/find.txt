"""Finds all locations of an item in an array or string."""

Returns an array of locations where the search term is found in the string or
array.

If it cannot be found, an empty array is returned.

An empty string is never found in a string.  This differs from Python
where empty strings are found at the start of the string.

The stop and end values constrain the search to those
ranges.  The end index is not included in the search, so should be
`len(array)` to search the entire array.  The start index is included.

Negative indices are not supported for the find range.
