= PBR Single Scatter =

"""Creates a Single Subsurface Scatter BSDF."""

Models SSS illumination using single scattering.

@inputs

label:
    The component label to associate with this BSDF.

mfp:
    Scatter Distance.
    How quickly the light intensity decreases as it scatters. Larger values will make the material more transmissive.

sssclr:
    Subsurface Color.
    The color the surface will tend toward in unlit areas. This value adjusts the density so that the color components with higher attenuation color values will scatter light at longer distances, while color components with a low attenuation color will scatter at shorter distances.

g:
    Scattering Phase.
    Controls the nature of the scattering. Positive values give forward scattering, `0` gives isotropic scattering, and negative values give backscattering. Range is `-1` (full backscattering) to `1` (full forward scattering).

    The value depends on the type of material you are trying to model. For example, skin is highly forward scattering, while marble is backscattering.

eta:
    Relative IOR.
    Ratio of index of refraction of surrounding medium over the surface medium (the physical material the shader is simulating the look of).

color:
    Base Color.
    This is the dominant color that will appear in lit areas of the surface.

@outputs

bsdf:
    The PBR BSDF.
