"""Cooks a SOP asset for each point in the source geometry and instances the generated points onto the point."""

== Overview == (oview)

    This procedural shader lets you specify a SOP asset to generate instanced geometry at render time. If any attributes on the source points have the same name as parameters on the asset, Mantra sets the parameters to the attribute values, then cooks the SOP to generate the geometry for the point. This is very similar in spirit to Copy Stamp.

    WARNING:
        This procedural only allows the generation of points (no primitives).

    WARNING:
        To render a scene using this procedural, you must ensure mantra is using at least basic engine mode, using the `-e basic` command line option or the `MANTRA_ENGINE_PROCEDURAL` environment variable. See [the help for -e|/render/batch#mantra].
