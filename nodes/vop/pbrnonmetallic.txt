"""Computes reflections and refractions for dielectric (non-metallic) materials."""

This node computes reflections, refractions or both.

It can be used to build more compplex materials by plugging other BSDF VOPs into its base layer input.

@parameters

Specular Model:
    #id: model

    The mathematical model used to simulate glossy reflections. For each viewing angle and surface normal, the model defines from which directions and at what intensity light is reflected. This is what shapes specular highlights and reflections in general.

    The overall glossiness, and with it the size of highlights, is controlled by __Roughness__. The available models simulate the effects caused by __Roughness__ with varying degrees of physical accuracy, with GGX currently being the most accurate.

    The chosen model has no effect when __Roughness__ is `0`, since this causes light to be reflected from a single direction at full intensity, making the model irrelevant.

    See __Roughness__ for more information.


Reflection Label:
    #id: reflectlabel

    Specifies a label for the reflection BSDF. This can be used to export
    contributions from this component to a separate image plane.

Refraction Label:
    #id: refractlabel

    Specifies a label for the refraction BSDF. This can be used to export
    contributions from this component to a separate image plane.

Reflect:
    #id: reflect

    Controls the amount of reflection output.

Refract:
    #id: refract

    Controls the amount of reflection output.

Roughness:
    #id: rough
    Controls how dull a surface appears. A value of `0.0` results in a smooth surface with perfectly sharp reflections. A value of `1.0` produces a completely dull surface.

    This simulates microscopic bumps which become more pronounced the higher the __Roughness__, causing reflected light to be scattered more.

Anisotropy:
    #id: aniso
    #contentfrom: /nodes/vop/principledshader#aniso

Anisotropy Direction:
    #id: anisodir
    [Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#anisodir]

Color:
    #id: color

    Tints both reflections and refractions.

Index of Refraction:
    #id: ior
    Higher values reflect more light and bend refraction rays more.

    The impact on reflectivity is strongest on surfaces facing directly towards the viewer. Surfaces facing less directly towards the viewer generally reflect more light, regardless of this parameter's value.

    NOTE:
	The shininess of a surface also depends greatly on its __Roughness__.

Surface Priority:
    #id: priority
    [Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#priority]

Dispersion:
    #id: dispersion
    [Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#dispersion]

Transmittance Color:
    #id: transcolor
    [Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#transcolor]

At Distance:
    #id: transdist
    [Include:/nodes/vop/standard_shading_parms#transdist]

Thin Film Refractions:
    #id: thinfilm
    Treat the shaded surface as an infinitely thin surface rather than a surface of a solid object.

Energy Conserving Fresnel Blend:
    #id: fresblend
    Blend the reflection and refraction components in a physically correct manner. Conserve energy when layered on top of a base layer input.

Shade Both Sides As Front:
    #id: frontface
    Shades both sides of the surface as if they were the front.

    NOTE:
	This produces incorrect results for transparent surfaces.

Shade Back Side:
    #id: shadebackface
    When __Shade Both Sides As Front__ is disabled, this controls whether the back side receives any shading at all. When disabled the backside renders black.
