@parameters

Specular Model:
    #id: model
    #contentfrom: /nodes/vop/pbrnonmetallic#model

Component Label:
    #id: label

    Specifies a label for the metallic reflection BSDF. This can be used to export
    contributions from this component to a separate image plane.

Reflectance:
    #id: Fzero
    Controls the reflectivity of surfaces facing the viewer.

    When a surface is rotated away from the viewer, more and more light is reflected regardless of this parameter's value. At 90 degrees away from the viewer, 100% of the light is reflected, as in the real world.

    TIP:
	How shiny an object appears mostly depends on its __Roughness__ rather than its __Reflect__ value. When you intend to vary shininess using a texture, __Roughness__ is usually the better parameter to use.

    NOTE:
	For additional artistic control, you can disable reflections completely by setting __Reflect__ exactly to `0.0`. When using a texture, this effect also occurs in completely black areas of the texture.


Roughness:
    #id: rough

    Controls how dull a surface appears. A value of `0.0` results in a smooth surface with perfectly sharp reflections. A value of `1.0` produces a completely dull surface.

    This simulates microscopic bumps which become more pronounced the higher the __Roughness__, causing reflected light to be scattered more.

Anisotropy:
    #id: aniso
    #contentfrom: /nodes/vop/principledshader#aniso

Anisotropy Direction:
    #id: anisodir
    #contentfrom: /nodes/vop/principledshader#anisodir

Shade Both Sides As Front:
    #id: frontface
    Shades both sides of the surface as if they were the front.
