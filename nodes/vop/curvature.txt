"""Computes surface curvature."""

This VOP computes the amount of surface curvature, with white in convex areas, black in concave areas and 50% gray in flat areas. This is useful for masking wear like scratches and dents, which often happen on raised edges.

NOTE:
    Derivatives for polygonal meshes are not continuous, which results in a "faceted" look. To evaluate smooth curvature for meshes you should enable __Smooth__. However, __Smooth__ is ignored and relies on fine dicing to generate smooth look, when rendering subdivision mesh. If you see faceting with subdivision mesh, increasing __Shading Quality__ or reducing __Dicing Flatness__ will help.

@inputs

Point:
    #id: P
    Input surface point. If not connected the global variable of the same name is used.

Normal:
    #id: N
    Input surface normal. If not connected the global variable of the same name is used.

@parameters

Mode:
    #id: mode
    Selects between various curvature properties. __Gaussian__ is the product of the principal curvatures. __Mean__ is half the sum of the principal curvatures.

Space:
    #id: space
    Selects the output space of the curvature value. `-1 to 1` uses a mid-point of `0.0`, with convex areas from `0.0 > 1.0` and concave areas from `-1.0 > 0.0`. `0 to 1` uses a mid-point of `0.5`, with convex areas from `0.5 > 1.0` and concave areas from `0.0 > 0.5`.

Smooth:
    #id: smooth
    Enables smooth evaluation of curvature for polygonal meshes. Smooth evaluation also ignores any displacement the material may have on it.

Tolerance:
    #id: tolerance
    Determines how small a change in curvature is considered when shading the gradient.

Scale:
    #id: scale
    Multiplies the output curvature value. If you are seeing any curvature shading you should increase this value until the gradient is visible.

Bias:
    #id: bias
    This acts as a contrast control over the gradient, with values higher and lower than `0.5` resulting in more and less contrast.

Bias Map:
    #id: biasmap
    Varies the bias by a pattern. This is useful for breaking up smooth areas of the gradient. It should be mapped with a greyscale pattern, in the [0,1] range.

@outputs

Curvature:
    #id: K
    Output curvature value.
