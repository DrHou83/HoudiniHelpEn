= Ocean Sample Layers =

"""Sample ocean values from layered ocean spectra at the specified position and time."""

This VOP evaluates and samples ocean displacement, velocity, and/or cusp values from 
layered ocean spectra created via one or more [Ocean Spectrum|Node:sop/oceanspectrum] nodes.

The spectra are input to the __Geometry File__ parameter.  Optionally, any animated mask volumes
from the spectra can be input to the separate __Mask Geometry File__ parameter to split static
spectrum geometry from animated mask geometry and save disk space.  This VOP will internally
execute an inverse Fast Fourier Transform to evaluate any spectral ocean input, so can be used
for render-time evaluation of ocean spectra.  The __Sample Position__ input should generally be
in object space.

In SOPs the __Geometry File__ parameter can also be the evaluated "rest volume" output of an
[Ocean Evaluate|Node:sop/oceanevaluate] SOP, such as __Rest Displacement__, in which case no internal
FFT execution is required.

During rendering this VOP will automatically downsample any input spectra when the smallest
wavelength present in the spectra becomes too small to resolve with the current shading
sample area, which would otherwise lead to aliasing.  The __Anti-Alias Blur__ parameter
is a scale on the shading sample before measuring against wavelength.  Decrease its value
to reduce the amount of downsampling done, or set to zero to disable completely.  This parameter
currently only has an effect in the Displacement and Surface contexts.

The remaining parameters match the equivalent ones on the [Ocean Evaluate SOP|Node:sop/oceanevaluate].
