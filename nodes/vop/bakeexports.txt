= Bake Exports =

"""Export shading for use in bake image planes"""

This VOP exports common shading properties used when baking geometry such as occlusion, tangent-space normals and displacement.

@parameters

Exports:
    #id: exports

    This VOP exports variables both from the displacement shader and the surface
    shader.

    This parameter controls which variables are exported, allowing separate
    VOPs to be used for the surface and displacement values.

    This can be necessary to prevent surface-shading VOPs from being included
    in the displacement shader.

    Displacement & Surface:
	Export both displacement and surface shading variables.

    Displacements:
	Export only displacement variables.

    Surface:
	Export only surface variables.
