= Report Error =

"""Optionally report a custom VEX error or warning."""

This operator is used to optionally report a formatted text string as a
VEX error or warning.  It uses the exact same format as the [Node:vop/print].

Any number of inputs can be connected to this operator. These inputs can
be integer, float, vector, vector4, matrix3, matrix, or string data. By
default, each input value will be printed with the name of the output
connected to the input, followed by the actual value. the values are
separated by tabs. So connecting a vector input `P` and a float input
`alpha` would result in string that looked like this:

{{{
P: { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }     alpha: 1.0
}}}

NOTE:
    In a multi-context material network, the Report Error node needs to somehow be
    connected to a context output to work. The minimal way to do this is to
    connect a Null VOP into the context output node, and then connect the Report Error 
    node's output to the Null node's second input.

@parameters
    Format String:
        This string specifies how the input values will be formatted and
        reported. Any text can be entered here. To specify that the
        value from a particular input should be displayed, use "%". The
        inputs will be displayed in the order in which they are
        connected. To display a `%` character, use `\\%`. To display a
        "\", use `\\\\`. To specify the start of a new line, use `\\n`. A
        new line character is automatically put at the end of the string
        when it is output to the console. To place a TAB in the text,
        use `\\t`. Any input value that does not explicitly appear in
        the Format String is appended to the end of the string using the
        format described above for the default behavior.
@inputs
    Report As:
        This integer indicates whether the message should (0) not be reported
        at all, (1) be reported as a warning, or (2) be reported as an error.
    Input Value 1...N:
        The input values to be put in the output string.
    Next Input:
        Where the next input value should be connected. Up to 64 inputs
        can be specified.
@outputs
    Formatted Output Text:
        The string created by formatting the input values according to
        the details in the Format String, even if Report As is 0 (Nothing).
