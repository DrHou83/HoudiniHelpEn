= Set Channel Value =

"""Sets a channel value when evaluating a __Channel VOP__ in Channel/Sample modes."""

This operator sets a value for the current evaluated channels.
It can set multiple channels if the val input is a vector or a matrix.

@parameters:

Channel Offset:
    An index offset to add to the current evaluated channel index when setting the channel value. This is only useful if you are iterating over multiple channels and wants to write to channels values one at a time or a vector at a time.
