"""Represents export parameters in a shader call."""

== Overview ==

When a shader node is used as part of a larger shader, it generates source code that performs a shader function call. The call may contain export parameters that are not available as output connectors on the shader node. This node helps accessing such export parameters, by presenting them as own output connectors.
