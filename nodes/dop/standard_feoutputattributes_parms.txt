Create Quality Attributes:
    #id: createqualityattributes

    This creates a primitive attribute 'quality' on the simulated geometry. The worst quality is 0, the best quality is 1. The better the quality of the primitives, the better the performance and stability of the solve will be.

Create Energy Attributes:
    #id: createenergyattributes

    This toggle allow the object to generate attributes that indicate the density of kinetic energy and potential energy. In addition, an attribute that indicates the density of the rate of energy loss is generated.

Create Force Attributes:
    #id: createforceattributes

    This toggle allows force attributes to be generated.

Create Collision Attributes:
    #id: createcollisionattributes

Create Fracture Attributes:
    #id: createfractureattributes
