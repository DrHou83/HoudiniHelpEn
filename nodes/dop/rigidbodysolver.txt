= Rigid Body Solver =

""" Sets and configures a Rigid Body Dynamics solver. """

The RBD Solver DOP sets objects to use the Rigid Body Dynamics solver.

If an object has this DOP as its `Solver` subdata, it will evolve itself as an [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject].

This solver is a union of two different rigid body engines, the RBD engine and the Bullet engine.
The RBD engine uses volumes and is useful for complicated, deforming, stacked, geometry.
The Bullet engine offers simpler collision shapes and is suitable for fast, large-scale simulations.

Details on the first engine are found in the [RBD Solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver].

The RBD and Bullet engines also have support for voronoi fracturing. For more information see the [Voronoi Fracture Solver|Node:dop/voronoifracturesolver] help. You must have a [Voronoi Fracture Configure Object|Node:dop/voronoifractureconfigureobject] for voronoi fracturing to work.

Details on the second engine are found in the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

@parameters

Solver Engine:
    Choose between a Bullet or RBD Solver.

== Bullet ==

    [Include:bullet_solver_parms]

== RBD ==

=== Substeps ===

[Include:rbd_solver_substeps]

=== Collisions ===

@inputs

Objects:
    The objects to solve.

Pre-Solve:
    Microsolvers attached to this input will run before the main solve step. For example, a [SOP Solver|Node:dop/sopsolver] can be used to modfiy the object's geometry, and POP force nodes can be used to [apply forces|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject#forceattributes] to specific objects.

Post-Solve:
    Microsolvers attached to this input will run after the main solve step.

@outputs

[Include:standard_data_outputs]

@locals

[Include:standard_data_locals]

[Include:standard_locals]
