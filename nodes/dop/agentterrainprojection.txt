= Agent Terrain Projection =

"""Project the agent/particle points onto the terrain"""

This node projects agents/particles onto the terrain.

@parameters

Activation:
	Whether or not to activate this node.
Terrain Source:
    Source for the terrain object (SOP path or DOP object)
Mode:
    #id: mode
    Controls direction of the terrain projection.

    Direction Vector:
        Use the direction specified.
    Up Attribute:
        Use the agent's `up` attribute.
Sampling Method:
    #id: samplingmethod
    Specifies whether to cast a single ray from the agent's point, or to cast a ray from each of the agent's legs.
Sample From Agent's Plane:
    #id: projectsamples
    When __Sampling Method__ is __Foot__, projects the foot positions into the plane defined by the agent's position and the __Direction Vector__ before casting rays.
    This produces results that are consistent with the __Particle__ sampling method if the agent is on flat terrain.
    If this option is disabled, the agent will be lowered by the average distance of each foot from the terrain.
Offset:
    #id: offset
    Additional offset that will shift all agents up or down.

Project Forces:
    If enabled, the `force` point attribute will be projected into the plane defined by the terrain normal.

Normal Attribute:
    When enabled, an attribute will be output indicating the normal of the terrain geometry underneath the agent.

Prim Num Attribute:
    When enabled, an attribute will be output indicating which primitive the agent was projected onto in the terrain geometry.

Prim UVW Attribute:
    When enabled, an attribute will be added with the coordinates where the agent was projected onto the terrain geometry.

Offset Attribute:
    When enabled, an attribute will be added with the agent's offset from the terrain (according to the __Mode__, __Sampling Method__, and __Offset__ parameters).
    This can be used in combination with the primitive number and UV coordinates to stick agents onto deforming terrain geometry.

@inputs

Agents:
    The packed primitive agents to modify. 

@outputs

Agents:
    The modified packed primitive agents with terrain projection applied.
