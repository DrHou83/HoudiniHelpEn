Import Target Geometry:
    #channels: /importtargetgeometry

    This option allows you to specify and animate the target positions that are used by the simulation inside the SOP network (without having to use a SOP solver). The option defines whether the target positions should be imported from a SOP geometry node at each frame. When enabled, the solver will copy target positions from the point attribute `targetP` of the SOP geometry node onto the attribute `targetP` on the simulation geometry at each frame. If no `targetP` exists, then the `P` attribute from the SOP geometry node is copied instead.

Target Geometry Path:
    #channels: /targetgeometrypath
    
    The path to the SOP node that will serve as the source of the target positions. The positions should be stored in an attribute with the name `targetP`. If this attribute is not found, the `P` attribute is used as a fallback. 
 
Stiffness:
    #channels: /stiffness
    
    This coefficient determines how strongly the finite element solver tries to make the point positions match the target point positions. The solver creates an imaginary potential force for this purpose.

Damping:
    #channels: /damping
    
    This coefficient determines how strongly the finite element solver tries to make the point velocities match the target point velocities. The solver creates an imaginary dissipation force for this purpose.
