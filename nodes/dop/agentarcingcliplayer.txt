"""Blends between a set of animation clips based on the agent's turn rate."""

This node blends between a set of animation clips based on the agent's turn rate (the `agentturnrate` point attribute).
A common use case is to blend between variants of the agent's base cycle where the character is turning to the left or right.
This allows for more realistic motion when turning (such as leaning for quadrupeds) compared to only adjusting the agent's orientation.
Typically, this node should be wired before any other [Agent Clip Layer DOPs|Node:dop/agentcliplayer] in the state so that the clips are blended with the agent's base pose.

:note:
    Since the clip blending is based on the agent's turn rate, it is important that the turn rate changes smoothly to avoid sudden changes to the agent's pose.
    The [crowd solver's|Node:dop/crowdsolver] turn acceleration parameters can be useful to achieve smoother turning.
