Substeps:
    This is the number of substeps that the solver executes per frame. In general, the higher the value is chosen, the better the quality and the accuracy of the simulation will be. However, the solve time per frame may increase. When you're having trouble with a simulation's quality or stability, the first thing to try is increasing __Substeps__.
