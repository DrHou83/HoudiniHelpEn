#type: include
Import Rest Geometry:
    #channels: /importrestgeometry

    This option allows you to specify and animate the rest positions that are used by the simulation inside the SOP network (without having to use a SOP solver). The option defines whether the rest positions should be imported from a SOP geometry node at each frame. When enabled, the solver will copy rest positions from the point attribute `restP` of the SOP geometry node onto the attribute `restP` on the simulation geometry at each frame. If no `restP` exists, then the 'P' attribute from the SOP geometry node is copied instead. 
    
Rest Geometry Path:

    #channels: /restgeometrypath

    The path to the SOP node that will serve as the source of the rest positions.
