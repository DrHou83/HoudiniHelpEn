#type: include

Thickness:
    #id: shellthickness
    
    This determines the volume of the cloth per area.

Stretch Stiffness:
    #id: stretchstiffness

    This determines how strongly the object resists local stretching in the U and V directions (see the `materialuv` attribute).

Shear Stiffness:
    #id: shearstiffness

    This determines how strongly the object resists local shearing between the U and V directions (see the `materialuv` attribute).

Bend Model:
    #id: bendmodel

    This determines the type of model that's used for internal forces that resist bending.
 
Weak Bend Stiffness:
    #id: weakbendstiffness	

    This determines how strongly the object resist local bending under the weak bend model
  
Strong Bend Stiffness:
    #id: strongbendstiffness	

    This determines how strongly the object resist local bending under the strong bend model.
     
Seam Angle:
    #id: seamangle

    This prescribes the rest angle between different panels.
