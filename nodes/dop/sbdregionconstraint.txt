= Finite Element Region Constraint =

"""Constrains regions of a solid object or a hybrid object to another solid or hybrid object."""

This constraint can be used to constrain objects together in a region where one object contains or overlaps the other object. This is a soft constraint, which means that the positions of the two objects don't match exactly in the region. Instead, the strength and damping of the constraints are used to generate internal energy densities. The __Strength__ parameter under the Soft Controls tab can be used how strong the soft constraint force is that keeps the points together. The correspondign __Damping__ parameter can be fine tuned to avoid oscillations of the soft constraint force due to overshooting.

@parameters

== Soft Controls ==
    Strength:
	#channels: /strength

	If __Type__ is __Soft__, then this controls the strength of the soft constraint force that pushes the pairs of points together.

    Damping:
	#channels: /damping

	If __Type__ is __Soft__, then this controls how the strength of the soft constraint force that matches the velocities of the constrained point pairs.

== Guide Options ==

    Show Guide Geometry:
	Turning on this option causes guide geometry to be displayed in the viewport representing this constraint.

    Radius:
	#channels: /guiderad

	Controls the radius of the spheres drawn in the viewport as guide geometry for this constraint.

    Color:
	#channels: /guidecolorr /guidecolorg /guidecolorb

	Controls the color of the guide geometry.

    Show Object Link:
	#channels: /showobjectlink

	Controls the display of guide geometry connecting the constraint to the constrained object.
