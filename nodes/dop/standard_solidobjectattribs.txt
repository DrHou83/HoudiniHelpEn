== User Control Attributes ==

You can locally change the material properties of the Solid Object using point attributes. At a rule of thumb, each parameter on the [Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject] has a multiplier point attribute that has the same name as that parameter.

For example, you can make some tetrahedrons resists changes in shape more than other tetrahedrons.
These attributes work as multipliers for the parameters in the __Model__ tab. The stiffness multiplier is a convenient way to modify the local stiffness for all object types that are recognized by the solver.

These multipliers affect the overall behavior:

table>>
    tr>>
        th>> Name
        th>> Class
        th>> Type
        th>> Description
    tr>>
        td>> `stiffness`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>> Multiplier for all types of internal stiffnesses.
    tr>>
        td>> `dampingratio`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>> Multiplier for the damping ratio.
    tr>>
        td>> `massdensity`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>> Multiplier for the mass density.
	
These multipliers affect the behavior of specific types of internal forces:

table>>
    tr>>
        td>> `shapestiffness`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>> Multiplier for internal force that resists local changes in shape.
    tr>>
        td>> `shearstiffness`
        td>> Point
        td>> Float
        td>> Multiplier for internal force that resists local changes in volume.
