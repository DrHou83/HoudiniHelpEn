= Hybrid Configure Object =

"""Attaches the appropriate data for Hybrid Objects to an object."""

The Hybrid Configure Object DOP takes a simulation object and attaches
the data which is needed for it to be used as a [Hybrid Object|Node:dop/hybridobject].

This DOP is very similar to the [Hybrid Object DOP|Node:dop/hybridobject], except it allows you to explicitly control the creation of the object using another DOP, such as the [Empty Object DOP|Node:dop/emptyobject]. This can be used for more advanced instancing or creating objects every 10 frames.
