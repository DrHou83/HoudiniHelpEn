= Constraint Network Visualization =

"""Visualizes the constraints defined by constraint network geometry."""

The Constraint Network Visualization DOP creates guide geometry for the constraints defined by a [constraint network|Node:dop/constraintnetworkrelationship].

The [Constraint Network DOP|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] should be used instead of building from this node.

@parameters
Show Guide Geometry:
    Controls whether the visualization is created.

Show Object Link:
    Specifies whether to draw guide geometry connecting the constraint anchors to their corresponding objects.
