Stiffness Multiplier:
    #channels: /shellstiffness

    This is a convenient multiplier for both the __Shape Stiffness__ and the __Bend Stiffness__ of the shell polygons. This multiplier has no units.

Damping Ratio:
    #channels: /shelldampingratio

    This unitless parameter controls how quickly the shell polygons stop deforming.

Mass Density:
    #channels: /shellmassdensity

    This is the density of mass per volume for the polygons.
    
Thickness:
    #channels: /shellthickness
    
    This specifies the volume per surface area for the shell polygons.
Shape Stiffness:
    #channels: /shellshapestiffness
    
    This determines how strongly the shell polygons resist local deformation in directions tangent to the shell.

Bend Stiffness:
    #channels: /shellbendstiffness
    
    This determines how strongly the shell polygons resist local deformation in directions normal to the shell.
