"""Turns input values for the gamepad or joystick device into channel outputs."""

This CHOP listens for gamepad or joystick input, including all of the selected 
device's buttons, axes, trackballs and POVhats, and outputs channel data.


The range of axis values is scaled to -1 to 1 (originally -32768 to 32767).
0 means the axis is placed at center.

For buttons, the chop output 1 when pressed, 0 when released.

For trackballs, the chop outputs dx and dy, denoting deltas in x and y position.
HOWEVER, this part is NOT tested NOR scaled, due to lack of access to such device.

For POVhats, the chop outputs its direction which is comprised of up to 2 of the 
following 4 directions: up, down, left, right. It can also be centered.

The Gamepad and [DeviceTransform|Node:chop/devicetransform] CHOPs can be used 
together to drive objects (like the camera object) in a "First-Person" way.

This CHOP provides two interaction modes:
1. The gamepad mode requires the connected device to be a gamepad, 
   and the corresponding menu and default channel names are more explicit

2. The joystick mode should support generic joysticks, including gamepads.
   However, the default channel names are generic as well, and may require 
   further mapping.

@parameters

== Settings ==

Interaction Mode:
    Gamepad mode supports game controllers such as PS or Xbox gamepads.
    Joystick mode supports general joysticks.

Controller Source:
    Select the desired input device from the dropdown of this parameter.

Deadzone:
    Specify the deadzone by percentage of the max value. For example,
    0.2 means all inputs below 20% of the max possible input
    will be ignored.
    
    NOTE:
        This parameter should NOT be used regularly. Install the corresponding driver for the controller instead.

== Outputs ==

== Gamepad Mode ==

    Left Stick X Axis:
        Specify the output channel name of values from left stick X axis.

    Left Stick Y Axis:
        Specify the output channel name of values from left stick Y axis.
    
    Right Stick X Axis:
        Specify the output channel name of values from right stick X axis.
    
    Right Stick Y Axis:
        Specify the output channel name of values from right stick Y axis.

    Left Trigger (L2):
        Specify the output channel name of values from left trigger (LT/L2).

    Right Trigger (R2):
        Specify the output channel name of values from right trigger (RT/R2).

    Left Bumper (L1):
        Specify the output channel name of left bumper (LB/L1) button state.

    Right Bumper (R1):
        Specify the output channel name of right bumper (RB/R1) button state.    

    Left Stick Down:
        Specify the output channel name of whether left stick is pressed.

    Right Stick Down:
        Specify the output channel name of whether right stick is pressed. 

    Direction Pad Buttons:
        Specify the output channel names of the button states of the direction
        pads. This parameter should be in the form: xxx[1-4] as there are only 4
        buttons on a d-pad.

    Action Buttons:
        Specify the output channel names of the button states of the A, B, X, Y
        buttons (on xbox gamepad) or X, O, Square, Triangle (on PS gampad)

    Back Button:
        Specify the output channel name of back button state ("SHARE" on PS4 gamepad).

    Guide Button:
        Specify the output channel name of guide button state ("PS" on PS4 gamepad).

    Start Button:
        Specify the output channel name of start button state ("OPTIONS" on PS4 gamepad).

== Joystick Mode ==

    Joystick Axes:
        From the dropdown, select the desired axes to output from a list 
        of available axes provided by the joystick with generic names, 
        i.e. axis1, axis2...

    Joystick Buttons:
        From the dropdown, select the desired buttons to output from a
        list of available buttons provided by the joystick with 
        generic names, i.e. btn1, btn2...

    Joystick Trackballs:
        From the dropdown, select the desired trackballs to output from a
        list of available trackballs provided by the joystick with 
        generic names, i.e. ball1, ball2...
        
        NOTE:
            The output will be in the form: "ball1-dx", "ball1-dy"...

    Joystick POV Hats:
        From the dropdown, select the desired POV hats to output from a
        list of available POV hats provided by the joystick with 
        generic names, i.e. hat1, hat2...
        
        NOTE:
            If the device is a gamepad then there will be one hat available, which is the essentially the direction pads. The output will be in the form: "hat1-up", "hat1-down", "hat1-left", "hat1-right"...
