= Device Transform =

"""Turns data from device inputs into transform data"""

This CHOP takes input from one chop, uses the designated channels in calculation, and outputs transform channels.

It is recommended not to input initial rotations on the
objects when using this feature (translation works fine,
however).


This CHOP provides two transform modes (they are mainly
for cameras):

# The fixed mode fixes the object (camera) in a plane (which should ideally be parallel to the XZ plane)

# The free mode allows the object (camera) to move in the lookat direction.

For both modes, no tilt will be introduced as this is not desired for first-person cameras.

The Device Transform and [Gamepad|Node:CHOP/Gamepad] CHOPs can be used 
together to drive objects (like the camera object) in a "First-Person" way.


@parameters

== Settings ==

Transform Mode:
    The fixed mode fixes the object in a plane which should be 
    parallel to the XZ plane.
    The free mode allows the object to move in 
    the lookat direction

Translation Speed:
    Customize the translation speed. Default is 1 and
    range is 0-1000

Rotation Speed:
    Customize the rotation speed. Default is 5 and
    range is 0-20.

Reset Position:
    A button to set all outputs of the CHOP (except scale)
    to 0, essentially resetting the transform.

== Inputs ==

Back & Forth:
    Specify the name of the channel whose data will be used to move back & forth. Default is left stick y axis. Axis input expected. Positive is going forth.

Invert:
    Negate the input channel before using it (for instance, from a to -a).

Left & Right:
    Specify the name of the channel whose data will be used to move left & right. Default is left stick x axis. Axis input expected. Positive is going right.

Look Up & Down:
    Specify the name of the channel whose data will be used to look up & down. Default is right stick y axis. Axis input expected. Positive is looking up.

Look Left & Right:
    Specify the name of the channel whose data will be used to look left and right.  Default is right stick y axis. Axis input expected. Positive is looking right.

Increase Elevation:
    Increases `ty` directly regardless of current rotation. Default is right bumper. Axis or button inputs accepted.

Decrease Elevation:
    Increases `ty` directly regardless of current rotation. Default is left bumper Axis or button inputs accepted.

Accelerate:
    Temporarily increases translation speed by a multiplier of 1 to 10 according to input given. Default is right trigger. Axis or button inputs accepted.

Decelerate:
    Temporarily increases translation speed by a multiplier of 1 to 10 according to input given. Default is left trigger. Axis or button inputs accepted.
