"""Computes when position channels are stationary."""

This CHOP interprets the input channels as a position vector and creates a channel with a value of 1 where the positions are stationary.
This is useful for creating channels that describe when a character's feet are planted, which can be used for foot locking in a crowd simulation.

@parameters

Source:
    Specifies the source of the position data.

    Input Channels:
        The input channels are interpreted as a position vector.

    Object:
        Uses the position of the __Target Object__ relative to the __Reference Object__.

    Agent:
        Uses the world space position of an agent's bone.

Target Object:
    The object that is being compared to the reference object when __Source__ is __Object__.

Reference Object:
    Optional object that acts as the basis for the comparison when __Source__ is __Object__.

Offset:
    Specifies a local space position in the __Target Object__ when __Source__ is __Object__, or in the __Transform Name__ when __Source__ is __Agent__.

Frame Range:
    Specifies the frame range of the clip when __Source__ is __Object__.

SOP Path:
    The path to a SOP containing an agent primitive.
    If the geometry contains multiple agent primitives, the first primitive in the __Group__ will be used.

Group:
    Specifies a primitive group for the SOP geometry.

Clip Name:
    The name of an animation clip in the agent primitive's definition.

Transform Name:
    The name of a transform in the agent primitive's rig.

Method:
    Specifies the method used to determine when the joint is planted.

    Speed Threshold:
        The joint is considered planted when its speed is less than the __Speed Threshold__.

    Distance from Terrain:
        The joint is considered planted when it is within __Distance Threshold__ of the terrain.
        This can provide more robust behaviour than the __Speed Threshold__ method (such as when analyzing the ankle joint if a character is standing on their toes), but requires terrain geometry.

Speed Threshold:
    The speed threshold to use when determining if the joint is nearly stationary.

Terrain Source:
    Specifies the source of the terrain geometry when __Method__ is __Distance from Terrain__.
    This can either be a path to SOP geometry or a manually-specified plane.

SOP Path:
    The SOP geometry used when __Method__ is __Distance from Terrain__ and __Terrain Source__ is __SOP__.

Plane Origin:
    The origin point of the plane used when __Method__ is __Distance from Terrain__ and __Terrain Source__ is __Plane__.

Plane Normal:
    The normal of the plane used when __Method__ is __Distance from Terrain__ and __Terrain Source__ is __Plane__.

Distance Threshold:
    The maximum distance from the terrain where the joint is considered planted.

Channel Name:
    Specifies the name of the new channel.

Blend In Frames:
    Specifies the number of frames over which the channel value changes from 0 to 1 before the foot plant begins.

Blend Out Frames:
    Specifies the number of frames over which the channel value returns to 0 after the foot plant ends.
