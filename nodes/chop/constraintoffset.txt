= Constraint Offset =

"""Applies an transformation offset after evaluating a constraint."""

The Constraint Offset CHOP applies a transformation to revert the effect of a constraint. To do so, it needs to keep a pose of the object before the constraint was applied and the original evaluation of the constraint.
Given these two poses, an offset transformation is built and applied during evaluation.

The __Update Offset__ button evaluates the node's inputs and writes the result on the node's parameters.

The __Clear Offset__ button reverts the parameters back to an identity matrix.
