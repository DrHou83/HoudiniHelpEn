= Mouse 3D =

"""Turns input values for the Connexion space mouse into channel outputs."""

This CHOP listens for Connexion space mouse's inputs. Only outputs selected 
axes and buttons.

For buttons, the chop output 1 when pressed, 0 when released.
For axes, the output range varies accross platforms. The max is around 1 when
using Linux, 0.5 when using Windows.

The CHOP works in a way very similar to Gamepad [Gamepad|Node:chop/Gamepad].
Both of these two chops should be able to work together with devicetransform
[DeviceTransform|Node:chop/devicetransform]  to drive objects 
(like the camera object) in a "First-Person" way.
