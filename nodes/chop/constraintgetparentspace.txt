= Constraint Get Parent Space =

"""Returns an Object Parent Transform."""

The Constraint Get Parent Space CHOP returns the parent transform of an object before its constraints network is computed. If the parent is a bone, the root or the tip of its parent bone can be returned.

@parameters

== Get Parent Space ==

Transform Order:
    The left menu chooses the order in which transforms are applied. For example: scale, then rotate, then move. This can change the position and orientation of the object, in the same way that going a block and turning east takes you to a different place than turning east and then going a block.

    The right menu chooses the order in which to rotate around the X, Y, and Z axes. Certain orders can make character joint transforms easier to use, depending on the character.

Object:
    The object that is being queried.

Parent Bone:
    Specifies which transform to return if the parent object is a bone. This has no effect if the parent isn't a bone.

    Root:
        Returns the transform at the root of the parent bone.
    Tip:
        Returns the transform at the tip of the bone. This is the root transform translated along the bone axis by the bone length.
