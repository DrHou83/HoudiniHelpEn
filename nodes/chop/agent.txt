"""Imports an animation clip from an agent primitive."""

The Agent CHOP imports an animation clip from an agent primitive in a SOP network.
For each transform in the agent's rig, the clip will contain channels named `transform_name:channel_name` for each of `tx`, `ty`, `tz`, `rx`, `ry`, `rz`, `sx`, `sy`, and `sz`.
The transforms will be in local space, matching the format required by the [Agent Clip SOP|Node:sop/agentclip].
Any other channels, such as those specified by the __Additional Channels__ parameter on the [Agent ROP|Node:out/agent], will also be imported.

@parameters

SOP Path:
    The path to a SOP containing an agent primitive.
    If the geometry contains multiple agent primitives, the first primitive in the __Group__ will be used.

Group:
    Specifies a primitive group for the SOP geometry.

Fetch Mode:
    Specifies whether to import a clip from the agent's definition, or to create a clip from the agent's poses over the specified time range.

Convert to In-Place Animation:
    Specifies whether the agent's overall transform should be applied to its pose.

Clip Name:
    The name of an animation clip in the agent primitive's definition.

Space:
    Specifies whether the transform channels should be in local space or world space.
