= Constraint Object Offset =

"""Compares two objects and returns information on their relative positions and orientations."""

The Constraint Object Offset CHOP compares two objects and returns the relative transformation.

If either the target or reference objects (but not both) are missing, then the identity transform is used in place. This allows us to obtain the world transform of an object by only supplying a target object, or to obtain the inverse world transform of an object by only supplying the reference object.

The __Update Offset__ button evaluates the node's inputs and writes the result on the node's parameters.

The __Clear Offset__ button reverts the parameters back to an identity matrix.
