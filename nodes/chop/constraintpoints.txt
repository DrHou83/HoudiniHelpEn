"""Position and Orient an object using point positions from a geometry."""

The Constraint Points CHOP computes a position from a group of points on a geometry.
It can also optionally compute a rotation to make the object look at direction.

@parameters

== Constraint Points ==
SOP Path:
    The surface geometry to fetch the points from.

Mode:
    Groups can hold points or primitives. When using primitives, the points indices are extracted and the constraint works on the points.

Group:
    The point or primitive group (or numbers) based on which the local surface frame is built.
    The group centroid is set as the frame origin.

Weights:
    #id: weights

    The weights assigned to the first three points in the group.

    This parameter allows you to fine tune the exact position of the rivet origin on the plane constructed from the first three points.
    For example, the weights (0.5, 0.5, 0) will place the origin half way between the first and the second point.
    NOTE:
        The weights should not add up to 0. The points beyond the third one, if any, are assigned weight values of 1.

Look At Mode:
    Defines how to compute the Look At direction. The Lookat position can be overriden by connecting the second input.

    None:
	    Disable the Look At and keep the existing orientation.

    Direction Attribute from Points:
	    Use the average of the Direction Attribute from points in the group.

    Direction Vector from P0 to P1:
	    Use the first and second points to define a vector.

    Normal Vector from P0,P1,P2 Plane:
	    Use the normal vector of the plane made of the first 3 points.

Look Up Mode:
    Defines how to compute the Look At Up vector. The Look Up vector can be overriden by connecting the third input.

    Up Vector:
	    Use the Up Vector from the parameter pane.

    Up Vector Attribute from Points:
	    Use the average of the Up Attribute from points in the group.

    Direction Vector from P0 to P1:
	    Use the first and second points to define a vector.

    Normal Vector from P0,P1,P2 Plane:
	    Use the normal vector of the plane made of the first 3 points.

Direction Attribute:
    The attribute name representing the direction vector on the geometry.

Up Attribute:
    The attribute name representing the Up Vector on the geometry.

Look At Axis:
    Defines which of the 6 axis ( X-, Y-, Z-, X+, Y+, Z+) is oriented along the path.

Look Up Axis:
    Defines which of the 4 allowed axis act as the up direction. The allowed axis changes based on the Look At Axis. You can't use the same axis to define the look at and up directions.

Roll:
    Rotation around the direction vector in degrees.
