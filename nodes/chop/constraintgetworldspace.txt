= Constraint Get World Space =

"""Returns an Object World Transform."""

The Constraint Get World Space CHOP returns the world transform of an object before its constraints network is computed.

@parameters

== Get World Space ==

Transform Order:
    The left menu chooses the order in which transforms are applied. For example: scale, then rotate, then move. This can change the position and orientation of the object, in the same way that going a block and turning east takes you to a different place than turning east and then going a block.

    The right menu chooses the order in which to rotate around the X, Y, and Z axes. Certain orders can make character joint transforms easier to use, depending on the character.

Object:
    The object that is being queried.
