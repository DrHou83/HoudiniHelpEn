This is used to rectify the discontinuity of rotation data caused by cracking
matrices. 

@parameters

== Input ==
    
Use Transform Order:
	Select the checkbox to use the transform order parameter. If unchecked, the slerp order will be used. If slerp order is not provided, a default order will be used.

Transform Order:
	The left menu chooses the order in which transforms are applied (for example, scale, then rotate, then translate). The right menu chooses the order in which to rotate around the X, Y, and Z axes. 

Rotation Channels:
	Specify the desired channels to perform filtering. The three text boxes in turn corresponds to rx ry, and rz.

Use Rotation Hint:
	Supply approximate starting values for the rotation channels.

Hint:
	Supply approximate starting values for the rotation channels.
