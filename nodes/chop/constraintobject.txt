= Constraint Object =

"""Compares two objects and returns information on their relative positions and orientations."""

The Constraint Object CHOP compares two objects and returns the relative transformation.

If either the target or reference objects (but not both) are missing, then the
identity transform is used in place. This allows us to obtain the world
transform of an object by only supplying a target object, or to obtain the
inverse world transform of an object by only supplying the reference object.

@parameters

== Object ==

[Include:common#transformorder]

Target Object:
    The object that is being compared to the reference object.

Reference Object:
    The object that acts as the basis for the comparison.
