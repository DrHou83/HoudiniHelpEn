= Merge =

"""Takes multiple inputs and merges them into the output."""

This CHOP takes multiple inputs and merges them into the output. All the
channels of the input appear in the output. The channel order is the
channels of the first input followed by the channels of the second
input, and so on.

Channel names may conflict, but a channel is renamed according to the
_Duplicate Names_ menu.


@parameters

== Merge ==

    Align:
        The alignment option to use.

        Extend to Min/Max:
            Find the earliest start and latest end, and extend all
            inputs to that range using the extend conditions.
        Stretch to Min/Max:
            Find the earliest start and latest end, and stretch every
            channel's start and end to that range.
        Shift to Minimum:
            Find the earliest start and shift all channels so they all
            start at that index. All channels are extended to the length
            of the longest one.
        Shift to Maximum:
            Find the latest end and shift all channels so they all end
            at that index. Extend all channels to the length of the
            longest one.
        Shift to First Interval:
            Shift all channels to the start of the first channel and
            sample all inputs using the first input's range.
        Trim to First Interval:
            Trim all channels to first channel's range.
        Stretch to First Interval:
            Stretch all channels to the first channel's range.
        Trim to Smallest Interval:
            Trim all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The
            start and end values may not come from the same channel.
        Stretch to Smallest Interval:
            Stretch all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The
            start and end values may not come from the same channel.
    Mode:
        How to merge the channels from the different inputs and how to handle name conflicts.

        Duplicate. Make Unique Names:
            Duplicate channels following input order.
            On name conflict, make name unique by appending new channels.
        Duplicate. Keep First:
            Duplicate channels following input order.
            On name conflict, include only channel of the first input CHOP the name appears in.
        Duplicate. Keep Last:
            Duplicate channels following input order.
            On name conflict, include only channel of the last input CHOP name appears in.
        Override Existing Channels:
            Override channels from the first input with channels from the last.
            It ignores new channels not found in the first input and also
            keeps the channel order from the first input.
