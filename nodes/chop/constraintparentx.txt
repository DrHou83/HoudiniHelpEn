"""Reparent an object."""

The Constraint Parent CHOP reparents an object from a current parent to a new parent.

The first input is world transform of the object to reparent. The second input is the current parent transform. The third input is the new parent transform.

This CHOP node has a second output, which returns directly the previous parent.
