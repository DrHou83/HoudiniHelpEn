= Output =

"""Marks the output of a sub-network."""

This CHOP passes through each input to the corresponding output untouched.
When inside a subnetwork, its inputs become the corresponding outputs
of that subnetwork.

Each output node can specify which output it wires to.  Output index
0 corresponds to the first wire out of the node, and is also the
value the parent node will use when object merged or middle clicked.

Duplicate output indices will result in errors when cooked.
