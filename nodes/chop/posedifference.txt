= Pose Difference =

"""Computes the difference between two poses."""

This CHOP takes translate, rotate, and/or scale channels and computes the difference between them and a reference pose.
This is useful for preparing clips that can be used for [additive animation blending|Node:dop/agentcliplayer] in a crowd simulation.

@parameters

Reference Pose:
    Specifies a frame in the first input's clip to use as the reference pose.

    If the second input is connected, its samples are used as the reference poses instead.
    This allows computing the difference between two clips instead of the difference from a fixed pose.
