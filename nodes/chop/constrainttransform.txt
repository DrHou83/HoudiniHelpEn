= Constraint Transform =

"""Takes translate, rotate, and/or scale channels and transforms them."""

This CHOP takes translate, rotate, and/or scale channels and transforms
them either using the transform parameters in the CHOP or via other transform
channels from its second input. It can be used to:

* Change the position and orientation of an object.

* Convert a set of transform channels with a certain transform order
  into an equivalent set of channels with a different transform order.

* Change the direction, starting point, and scale of motion capture data.

* Build a constant transformation.

* Invert a transformation.

Currently, only one transform format exists: the transform defined by 9 channels (`tx ty tz, rx ry rz, sx sy sz`) and a transform order.

Invert Transform:
    If enabled, the transform will be inverted prior to being multiplied with the input.

Mode:
    The input channels can be pre or post multiplied by the transformation.
    It is also possible to return the first or second input and bypass the transformation.

Pivot Mode:
    The Pivot position and orientation can be defined in local space using the node 
    parameters or in global space using the third input. The Pivot Mode lets you use 
    the position and/or orientation from the Input #3.
