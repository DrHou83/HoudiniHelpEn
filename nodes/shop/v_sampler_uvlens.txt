= UV Lens Sampler =

"""This is the UV lens sampler."""

This shader is responsible for initializing rays for UV rendering with raytracing.

@parameters

unwrap_method:
        Selects the method used to unwrap from the 'UV Object'. `UV To Surface` maps the UVs to their locations on the surface of the object. `Trace Closest Surface` uses raytracing to find the surface closest to the 'UV Object'.

bias:
        Determines how much to offset the position of the ray from the surface of the object along the normal vector. This value should be increased proportional to the displacement in a displacement shader (if there is one) in order to ensure that the ray hits the surface.

maxdist:
        If `unwrap_method` is set to `Trace Closest Surface` this parameter controls the maximum distance to trace for nearby surfaces. Useful for limiting the areas of the scene that will be baked onto the low-res object.

flipnormal:
        Lets you to specify if the geometry being unwrapped has outward-facing normals or inward-facing normals.
