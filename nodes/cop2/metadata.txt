"""Applies metadata to an image sequence."""

Metadata applied to an image sequence can be read via the `copmeta` or `copmetas` expression functions in other parameters. Metadata can be in a variety of different formats, such as scalar float, vectors, matrices, and strings. Metadata cannot be animated. Metadata is created and accessed by name.
