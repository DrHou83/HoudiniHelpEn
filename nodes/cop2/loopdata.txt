= Loop Data =

"""Placeholder node within a Loop subnet for accessing the previous iteration's output."""

The Loop Data COP is only used within a [Loop COP|Node:cop2/loop]  subnetwork. Its purpose is to
provide access to the previous iteration's output image for the Loop COP.
The first iteration will receive the image data from the 
Loop COP's first input; all other iterations will receive the previous 
iterations' output.

COPs within the Loop subnet should use its output rather than connecting 
directly to the first subnetwork connector.

WARNING: 
   This COP should not be created on its own (it will not do anything).
