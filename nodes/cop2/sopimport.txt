= SOP Import =

"""Imports a 2d Volume from SOPs as planes into a composite network."""

This node cooks a SOP network.  Any volumes present will be copied into
corresponding named image planes.  Image planes with no corresponding
volumes will grab the first source volume.

The source volume will be scaled into the destination resolution.  A
direct one-to-one copy is only performed if resolutions are equal.
No filtering is done on downsampling, and only linear on upsampling,
so for best results a one-to-one transfer should be done followed
by a [Scale COP|Node:cop2/scale].

NOTE:
    Composite networks cannot be re-entrant, the SOP pointed to cannot
    depend itself upon the output of COPs.  Use a [Stash SOP|Node:sop/stash] where necessary
    to break dependencies.

@parameters

SOP Path:
    #id: soppath
    The SOP Node to cook.  It should consist of a number of named, two-dimensional, volumes.
Import:
    #id: importmask
    Volume names to import. Wildcards are accepted, as well as a whitespace separated list of names. Only volumes whose names match the list will be imported. Volumes without names will only be imported if the mask is '*' or empty.

Set Resolution from SOPs:
    #id: setres
    Turns on the __Override Resolution__ and sets it to the current resolution
    of the first volume in the pointed to network.  If no SOP or no volume
    is found, this does nothing.

Set Planes from SOPs:
    #id: setplanes
    Turns off the built-in list of plane generations and builds a custom
    plane list to import each named primitive in the source SOP.  If
    no SOP is found, does nothing.

Remap Range:
    #id: remaprange
    When on, the layers imported will be scaled and shifted to fit inside
    this range.
