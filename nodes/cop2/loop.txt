= Loop =

"""Cooks the subnet COPs multiple times in a loop, accumulating the results."""

The Loop COP is a COP subnet container. It cooks the COP network inside it 
multiple times. It either feeds the loop output back into the loop input, or
accumulates the results by adding the loop output images together.

The Loop COP can iterate over a single frame multiple times or iterate from
the first frame to the currently cooked frame, acting more like a simulation.

Inside the Loop COP, there is a [Loop Data COP|Node:cop2/loopdata] which is 
connected to the first subnet input. The results of the previous iteration will
be fed back to this node. The first iteration will use the first input's 
images. 

When in `Single Frame` loop mode, the `$AI` local variable can be used within 
the loop subnet to access the loop iteration (starting at 0 for the first 
iteration). When in `From Start Frame` loop mode, `$F` can be used as usual.

There are some restrictions placed on the COP network within the Loop COP. 
The network cannot change the frame range, image resolution, or add, remove, 
or modify planes (an error will result if you do). The [Loop Data COP|Node:cop2/loopdata] should 
always be connected directly to the first subnet input and
all COPs within the Loop subnet should use it the first input instead of the 
first subnet input connector. The other inputs (2-4) can be used directly.

Finally, the COP with the Render flag set is used as the loop output (as COPs
allow multiple display flags to be set).

@parameters

  == Loop ==

      Loop:
          Selects the looping mode.

          Single Frame:
              Loops multiple times over the same frame. This can be used to 
              apply the same effect multiple times.

          From Start Frame:
              Loops from the start frame of the sequence to the current frame.
              When used with `Feedback` loop mode, the effect of the COP 
              network is applied gradually over time like a simulation.

      Iterations:
          When using `Single Frame` looping, this parameter determines the 
          number of times to loop.
