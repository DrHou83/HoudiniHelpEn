= Terrain Noise =

"""Generate noise suitable for terrain height maps."""

Terrain noise generates noise patterns that can be used for landscapes. The 
noise can be post-processed by a ramp or extracting a slice of the noise. 

If an input is connected, the RGB values are used to sample the noise space.
Feeding noise into noise can produce some complex patterns.
