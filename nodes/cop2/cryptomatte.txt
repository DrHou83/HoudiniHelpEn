"""Extracts matte from Cryptomatte image."""

This node extracts matte from Cryptomatte image based on user selection. See
[Cryptomatte Overview|/render/cryptomatte] for more detail, including how to
generate Cryptomatte images using mantra.

Click ((LMB)) on Composite View to make a selection. Hold ((Shift)) and click
((LMB)) to add to current selection, or remove from current selection.

RGB channels are for preview only. The IDs that match the selection is
highlighted with checkerboard pattern. The extracted matte is outputted into
alpha channel.
 
NOTE:
    Only the first frame in a sequence is used to read the metadata, including
    the manifest. One way to work around incomplete manifest is to render using
    external manifest files and manually merge the contents afterwards.
