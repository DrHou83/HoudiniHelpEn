@parameters

Specify Exact Resolution:
    #id: fixedresample
    
    Specify the exact resolution to resample to. If this is off, you specify a scaling factor for the current resolution.
    
Resolution Scale:
    #id: resscale
    
    When __Specify exact resolution__ is off, the scaling factor to apply to the current resolution.

Division Mode:
    #id: divisionmode
    
    When __Specify exact resolution__ is on, whether the specify the resolution by number of grid points or by size.
    
    By Axis:
        Takes the longest axis of the current area and divides it by the number of samples in the __Grid samples__ parameter, then resamples using that grid spacing.

    By Size:
        Resample the volume using grid points spaced according to the __Grid spacing__ parameter.
    
Grid Samples:
    #id: gridsamples
    
    When __Division mode__ is "by axis", the number of grid points the resampled volume should have along the longest axis.

Grid Spacing: Grid spacing is the space in meters between grid points.
    #id: gridspacing
    
    When __Division mode__ is "by size", the grid spacing to use in the resampled volume.

Filter:
    #id: filter
    
    The 2D filter to use to interpolate the resampled values. Different filters might give various blurring or sharpening effects in the output.

Filter Scale:
    #id: filterscale
    
    How much effect the filter will have on the output. High values can give more blurring, depending on the filter type.
