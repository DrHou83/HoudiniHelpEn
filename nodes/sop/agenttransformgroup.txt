= Agent Transform Group =

"""Adds new transform groups to agent primitives."""

This node adds new transform groups to the agent definition, which are a named subset of the transforms in the agent's rig.
Transform groups can be used to apply animation clips to part of the agent's skeleton (such as with the [Agent Clip Layer DOP|Node:dop/agentcliplayer]).
See [Crowd Agents|/crowds/agents] for more information.

@parameters

Transform Groups:
    Group:
        The agents to modify.

    Transform Groups:
        The number of transform groups to create.

    Name:
        Specifies the name used to identify the transform group.
        All transform groups in an agent definition must have unique names.

    Root Transforms:
        Specifies a list or pattern of transform names.
        Each transform and its children will be added to the group.

    Blend into Group:
        Gradually increase the transforms' weights, beginning from the __Root Transforms__.
        This can be used to produce a smoother blend near the boundary when overriding part of the skeleton with a clip.
        When disabled, each transform in the group will have a weight of 1.

    Depth:
        Specifies the number of transforms to blend over when __Blend into Group__ is enabled.

    Transform Weights:
        Controls the weights of the transforms within the region specified by the __Depth__ parameter.

    Extra Transforms:
        Specifies a list or pattern of transform names to add to the group.

    Show Guide Geometry:
        Display guide geometry indicating the transforms contained in the group.

Guides:
    Scale:
        Adjusts the size of the guide geometry.
