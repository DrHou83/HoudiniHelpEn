"""Groups points and primitives by ranges."""

Creates groups of points and primitives according to ranges.  This is useful
if you wish to select every sixth polygon; or select the first half of
a geometry.

@inputs

Source geometry:
    The geometry on which to create the groups.

@parameters

Number of Ranges:
    The number of range groups to create.  

Group:
    Name of the group to create with a range.  If blank, no group
    will be created.

Group Type:
    Whether to group points or primitives into a range.

Merge Op:
    How to combine with an existing group of the same name.

Method:
    How to specify the range.

    Start/End:
	The start and end give the element numbers to begin and end the range
	with.  These are 0-based numbers, so 0 means the first element.
	The end element is included in the range, so a range of 5 to 5 will
	consist of the sixth element.
    Relative to Start/End:
	The start and end parameters provide the offset for the range.
	The start parameter gives the number of elements from the beginning,
	so a value of 5 means to skip 5 elements, so start with element six.
	The end parameter gives the number back from the end, so a value of 5
	means skip the last 5 elements, so stop the range with the sixth-last
	element.
    Start and Length:
	The start of the range is provided by the 0-based Start parameter.
	The provided length will select the number of elements to pick.
    Equal Partitions:
	The entire set of elements is broken into equal sized, consecutive,
	partitions.  If it does not divide evenly, boundary elements will
	be assigned to one partition or another (but never both).  The
	Partition parameter gives the 0-based partition to group.  If
	it is below zero or greater than equal to the number of partitions,
	no elements are grouped.

Start:
    The 0-based start of the range.
End:
    The 0-based end of the range.  This element is included in the range.
Length:
    How many elements to include in the range.
Partition:
    Which partition to group.
Number of Partitions:
    The number of equal-sized partitions to break the geometry into.
Invert Rnage:
    Rather than grouping the elements within the range, group the
    elements before and after the range.  This is useful for selecting
    just the first and last elements.

=== Range Filter ===

After grouping a contiguous range of primitives, this filter can select a subset of them in an alternating pattern.

Select `_` of `_`:
    Group every # of # primitives/points.

Offset:
    Where to start the range filter.  Measured relative to the start of the range.
