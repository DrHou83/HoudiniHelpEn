"""Blurs out (or "relaxes") points in a mesh or a point cloud."""

This node blurs any floating-point attributes, including position, color and texture coordinates.

Blurring point positions effectively smooths the geometry if points lie on a surface.

* For a high quality smooth, use the [Smooth node|Node:sop/smooth].

* To smooth by increasing the number of points, use the [Subdivide node|Node:sop/subdivide].

* To smooth by brushing over the object, use the [Sculpt tool|Node:sop/sculpt] and set one of the mouse buttons to __Smooth__.


== Using Attribute Blur ==

# Select the points you want to smooth.
            
# Click the [Icon:SOP/attribblur][Attribute Blur|/nodes/sop/attribblur] tool on the __Attribute__ tab.
            
You can change the blurring specifications in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

NOTE:
    If you only want to smooth certain areas of your object, use the [Icon:SOP/sculpt][sculpt|sculpt] tool.


@parameters

Group:
    Subset of points to smooth.

Attributes:
    The attributes to blur. Multiple attributes can be blurred at the same time.  If the field is blank, the node does nothing.

Method:
    Lets you choose different blurring models that have different effects on the point attributes. 

    Uniform:
        Blur attributes evenly regardless of their distance from one another.

    Edge Length:
        Blur attributes accounting for the fact that some points are closer than others.
        This option preserves relative distances between points, which is especially useful when points on the input are unevenly distributed.

Blurring Iterations:
    The number of times the input geometry is blurred.  The higher the number, the more blurring.

Mode:
    The mode chooses how to specify the size (or "strength") of each blurring iteration.

    Laplacian:
        Each iteration has the same size specified by the __Step Size__ parameter

    Volume Preserving:
        Iteration sizes are chosen to blur based on a noise frequency chosen by the __Cutoff Frequency__ parameter
    
    Custom:
        Lets the user provide the sizes of odd and even iterations manually.

Step Size:
    Size of each iteration when __Mode__ is set to __Laplacian__.

Cutoff Frequency:
    Noise frequency to remove. The larger this value, the more it will keep the original shape of the geometry. This option controls the blur strength in __Volume Preserving__ mode.

Odd Step Size:
    Size of each odd iteration. The first iteration has this size.

Even Step Size:
    Size of each even iteration. The second iteration has this size.

Weight Attribute:
    Optional point attribute used as a multiplier to each point displacement. The larger the weight, the stronger the blurring.

Pin Border Points:
    Fixes all points on unshared edges on a polygonal surface.  These points will not be blurred.
    This option can help prevent holes on a surface geometry from being enlarged when blurring point positions.

Influence Type:
    Burring relies on each point being able to see what its neighbors' attributes are.
    This parameter determines how points see their neighbors.  
    
    Connectivity:
        Neighbors are determined by mesh connectivity.  Each point mixes its attribute value with the value of its neighbors to achieve blurring.

    Proximity:
        Neighbors are determined by proximity.  Each point has a maximum number of neighbors given by the __Max Neighbors__ parameter, where each neighbor must be within a certain distance away given by the __Proximity Radius__ parameter.

Proximity Radius:
    Determines how far points influence each other when __Influence Type__ is set to proximity.

Max Neighbors:
    Determines the maximum number of neighbors each point is permitted to have.  Large numbers of neighbors may reduce performance.
