"""Converts point, primitive, edge, or vertex groups into point, primitive, edge, or vertex groups."""

Converts between different types of groups. When converting
groups, you can use wildcards to convert several
groups that match the specified pattern. For more
information about the pattern substitution rules, please see
[Attrib String Edit|Node:sop/attribstringedit].

@inputs

Source geometry:
    The geometry on which to create the groups.

@parameters

Number of Promotions:
    The number of group promotions rules to apply.  Promotions are applied
    in sequence, so if a group was promoted by an earlier rule and matches
    a later rule, it may be re-promoted.

Enable Promotion:
    Enables this rule.

Convert From:
    Source group type.

To:
    Newly created group type.
    
Group:
    Group to convert.
    
Convert Name:
    The new name of the converted group. Leave this empty to keep the name of the original group.
    
Keep Original Group:
    Do not remove the original group type.
    
Include Only Elements Entirely Contained in Original Group:
    This option allows only primitives that have all of their points or edges
    in the original point group to be included in the
    resulting primitive group, when converting from a point group or an edge group to a primitive group.

    The same thing applies when converting from a point group or a primitive group to an edge 
    group. Only edges with both points in the original point group will be added to the new group.
    
    When converting from an edge group to a vertex group, this causes only the vertices at the
    beginning of each edge be included.  In other words, each vertex is associated only with
    outgoing edges when this option is enabled.
    
Convert to Integer Attribute:
    When enabled and the __To__ type is Points, Primitives, or Vertices, this converts the output group
    to an integer attribute with values 0 (not in the group) and 1 (in the group) and then deletes the group.
