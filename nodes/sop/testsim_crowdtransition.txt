"""Provides a simple crowd simulation for testing transitions between animation clips."""

@parameters

== Transition ==

    Clip A:
        The name of the agents' initial animation clip.

    Clip B:
        The name of the animation clip to transition to.

    Trigger Frame:
        Specifies when to activate the trigger and start the transition.

== Guides ==

    Before Transition:
        Specifies a color for agents that have not started the transition.

    Pending Transition:
        Specifies a color for agents that are waiting to begin the transition (e.g. until they reach a certain time range in their animation clip).

    During Transition:
        Specifies a color for agents that are currently transitioning between the two states.

    After Transition:
        Specifies a color for agents that have finished the transition.
