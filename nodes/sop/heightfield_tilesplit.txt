"""Splits a height field volume into rows and columns."""

The usual workflow for this node is to animate the __Tile number__ parameter to extract each individual tile, for example in a [for-each loop|/model/looping], to save each one to an individual file. This can be useful to work on the tiles in parallel, or to break huge areas into chunks for a game engine.

You can add padding to the tiles so they overlap after being split. This can help avoid display cracking, and can help if you need to blend the tiles back together after modifying them individually.

Use [Height Field Tile Splice|Node:sop/heightfield_tilesplice] to stitch split tiles back together.


@parameters

Voxel Layout:
    #id: orient
    
    The orientation of the input volume. When this is set to "Auto" (the default), Houdini guesses the plane from the volume's orientation.

Tile Count:
    #id: tilecount
    
    Number of columns and rows to divide the volume into.

Extract Single Tile:
    #id: extracttile
    
    Only output the tile specified in the __Tile number__ parameter. This is useful to save or work on each tile individually in a [for-each loop|/model/looping]. If you turn this off, the output contains separate volumes for each tile, but all with the same names.

Tile Number:
    #id: tilenum
    
    Which tile to output, when __Extract single tile__ is on. If this value is greater than the total number of tiles, it wraps around.
    
    (You can calculate the total number of tiles using an expression like `ch("tilecountx") * ch("tilecounty")`.)
    
Voxel Padding:
    #id: voxelpad
    
    Amount of overlap to add across tile boundaries (in voxels).

Tile Lower Overlap:
    When extracting tiles, they will overlap their neighbours in the
    negative direction by this many voxels.

Tile Upper Overlap:
    When extracting tiles, they will overlap their neighbours in the
    positive direction by this many voxels.
