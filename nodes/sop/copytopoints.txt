"""Copies the geometry in the first input onto the points of the second input."""


== Overview ==

This is very useful for populating scenes with repeated elements such as trees, buildings, or snowflakes with full control over the placement of the copies. This is especially useful for copying geometry onto [particles|/particles/].

TIP:
    To simply create multiple copies of geometry without needing target points, use [Duplicate|Node:sop/duplicate].

For example, you can arrange copies in a spherical shape by copying them onto the points of polygonal sphere. Or you could [scatter|Node:sop/scatter] points across a terrain geometry and copy trees onto the points.

Note that this node creates additional geometry in the scene for each copy. If you have very large numbers of copies, you may want to investigate [render-time instancing|/copy/instancing] or [Alembic, packed primitives, or polysoups|/copy/packed_and_soups] to reduce memory usage.

This operator is especially useful for copying geometry onto the
points output from a  [particle system|/particles]  (that is, a [POP
network SOP|Node:sop/popnet]). Whereas  [particle
instancing|/particles/instancing_rendering]  displays the instanced geometry at
render time (and is more efficient), using the Copy SOP gives you
"real" geometry in the network that you can further manipulate.

For more information, see [copying to points|/copy/copytopoints] in the [copying and instancing|/copy/] chapter.


== Varying the copies == (instanceattrs)

* When you copy or instance geometry onto points, Houdini looks for specific attributes on the destination points to customize each copy/instance. For example, you can change the scale of each copy by creating a `pscale` attribute on the points you copy onto. See [instancing point attributes|/copy/instanceattrs].

* If you need more control over the copies, you can [use a For-Each loop|/copy/copytopoints#foreach] to process each copy individually.


== How to == (howto)
         
# Click the [Icon:SOP/copytopoints] Copy to Points tool on the __Modify__ tab.

# Select the source geometry you want to copy and press ((Enter)).

# Select the target geometry on whose points to instantiate the source and press ((Enter)).

@parameters

Source Group:
    A subset of the source (first input) primitives to copy from.
    You can create groups with the [Group SOP|Node:sop/group].

Target Points:
    A subset of the target (second input) points to copy onto.

Show Guide Geometry:
    Controls if the geometry being instanced onto is drawn.  Does
    not affect the behavior, only the viewport.

Transform Using Point Orientations:
    Rotates copies to face the target point normals. Also
    applies translations, rotations and scales according to the
    trans, rot, and scale point attributes on the template
    points (if these attributes exist).

Pack and Instance:
    Pack the input geometry into an Embedded Packed primitive before copying. This results in the input geometry being shared (instanced) by each copy rather than being duplicated for each copy.

    This only works if no source group is specified.

Pivot Location:
    Specifies how to initialize the offset for the point referenced by the
    packed primitive.

Display As:
    The viewport LOD for the specified packed primitives.

Copy Point Attributes:
    #channels: /doattr

    Copy attributes from the template points onto the copies,
    according to the values in the attribute fields below.

Attribute fields:
    #channels: /setpt /setprim /setvtx /mulpt /mulprim /mulvtx /addpt /addprim /addvtx /subpt /subprim /subvtx

    (Available when __Copy template point attributes__ is on
    above.)

    The _columns_ represent _possible ways of combining the
    attributes_ from template geometry with the attributes from
    the source geometry.

    Set:
        Copy the template attributes onto the copies.
    Mult:
        Multiply the template attributes by the corresponding
        source attributes.
    Add:
        Add the template attributes to the corresponding source
        attributes.
    Sub:
        Subtract the template attributes from the corresponding
        source attributes.
    The _rows_ represent _the different entities you can copy
    attributes onto_: points, primitives, and vertices.

    At the _intersection_ of each column and row, you can enter
    a list/pattern of attributes.

    For example:

    * To copy all attribute values from the template points to
      the primitive attributes of the copies, set the field at
      __Set/To Prim__ to `*`.

    * To multiply primitive colors by the template's colors, set
      the field at __Mult/To Prim__ to `Cd`.

    * To add the texture coordinates of the template to the
      coordinates of the source, set the field at __Add/To
      Point__ to __uv__.
