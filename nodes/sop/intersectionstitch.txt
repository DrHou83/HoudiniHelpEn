"""Composes triangle surfaces and curves together into a single connected mesh."""

This low-level node can be used to build higher-level tools dealing with intersecting geometry, such as the [Boolean node|Node:sop/boolean]. If you just want to merge polygonal geometry, use [Boolean|Node:sop/boolean].


@inputs

Connect a triangle mesh to the first input and a curve mesh to the second input (or the reverse). This node composes the inputs together into a single connected mesh.

If you don't connect the third input, the node uses the functionality from [Intersection Analysis|Node:sop/intersectionanalysis] to automatically find intersections in the meshes.

Optionally, you can connect the third input with point geometry with attributes as created by [Intersection Analysis|Node:sop/intersectionanalysis] or the [Scatter node|Node:sop/scatter]. This lets you edit the intersection points before using them to connect the meshes.


@parameters

Group A:
    A list of primitives to check from the first input. If this is blank, the node checks all primitives.

Group B:
    A list of primitives to check from the second input. If this is blank, the node checks all primitives.

Proximity Tolerance:
    How close points have to be (in Houdini units) for the node to connect them.

Split Curves:
    ???
