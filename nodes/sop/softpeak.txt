= Soft Peak =

"""Moves the selected point along its normal, with smooth rolloff to
surrounding points."""

Unlike the [Peak node|Node:sop/peak],
Soft Peak takes into account a rolloff function and a
radius of influence. The points within radius distance to the selected
point or group will be displaced by an amount proportional to the distance,
similar to the [Soft Transform node|Node:sop/softxform]


@parameters
    Group:
        Subset of points to translate.
    Distance:
        #channels: /dist

        Distance along normal by which to translate.
    Soft Radius:
        #channels: /radius

        Area of influence.
    Soft type:
        #id: type

        The type of rolloff for soft modifications. This affects how
        much influence your direct edits have on other points/faces
        with the soft radius, based on their distance.

        Linear:
            Linear falloff: the amount of influence decreases
            linearly with distance.
        Quadratic:
            Slow falloff: direct edits affect distant points/faces
            more than with Cubic.
        Cubic:
            Quick falloff: direct edits affect distant points/faces
            less than with Quadratic.
        Metaball:
            Calculate falloff according with the metaball density
            function you specify in the __Kernal function__
            parameter.
    Tangent Angles:
        #channels: /tandeg

        Angles of the cubic rolloff function's tangents. The first value
        applies to the tangent farthest from the source point, the
        second applies to the tangent closest to the source point.
    Kernel Function:
        [Metaball
        kernel|/nodes/sop/metaball#kernels]  to use
        when rolloff Type is "Meta-ball".
    Distance Metric:
        #id: distmetric

        Method for measuring which points are within the soft radius.

        Edge Distance:
            The shortest distance to a point in the group following a path along
            edges.
        Surface Distance:
            The shortest distance to a point int the group following a path
            along the surface.
        Radius:
            The 3D distance to the closest point in the group.
        Radius with Connectivity (deprecated):
            The 3D distance to the closest point in the group, as long as there
            is a connected path contained entirely within the __Soft Radius__.
    Translate Along Lead Normal:
        Translate points within the radius along the normal of the
        point in Group closest to them. Otherwise translate along their
        respective normals, giving a mushrooming effect.
    Recompute Point Normals:
        Recomputes point normals if they exist.
    Visualize Falloff:
        When to output the soft radius falloff as a `vis_falloff` point
        attribute.

        Never:
            Never create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute.
        Always:
            Always create and write to the `vis_falloff` attribute. 
        When Viewport Tool Is Active:
            Only create or write to the `vis_falloff` attribute temporarily
            when the viewport tool for this node is active.
@locals
    NPT:
        The number of points.
    NPR:
        The number of primitives.
