#type: include

div id="parmoverride">>
    This parameter can be overridden using an attribute or texture. To do this, select an option from the drop-down menu next to the parameter.

div id="opblend">>
    Blends the overall effect of the operation.

div id="groomdata">>
    NOTE:
	Groom data written to and read from files is expected to be packed and
	named in a specific way. Groom nodes such as [Guide
	Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom], [Guide Deform|Node:obj/guidedeform] or
	[Guide Sim|Node:obj/guidesim] write data in the expected format.

	These nodes use the [Guide Pack SOP|Node:sop/guidepack] to create these
	groom packages and [Guide Unpack SOP|Node:sop/guideunpack] to unpack
	and extract bits from them.


== Curve Mask == (curvemask)

Use Curve Mask:
    #id: usecurvemask
    Controls the effect of operations along the length of each curve.

    Enables the curve mask. All other parameters are hidden when this is
    disabled.

Range In Absolute Length:
    #id: curvemaskabsrange
    When enabled the range parameters below operate in world units.

Range Min:
    #id: curvemaskrangemin
    The position along the curve where the effect of the ramp starts. Curve
    points before this position use the first value of the ramp.

Range Max:
    #id: curvemaskrangemax
    The position along the curve where the effect of the ramp ends. Curve
    points after this position use the last value of the ramp.

NOTE:
    The parameters below quickly change the overall shape of the curve to achieve often needed effects, like affecting only roots or tips. Changing any of them modifies the ramp and replaces any manual edits on it.

Effect Position:
    #id: curvemaskeffectpos
    Sets the position where the curve is affected most. The root is at `0` and
    the tip at `1`.

Falloff:
    #id: curvemaskfalloff
    High values result in wide, bell-shaped ramp. Low values in a pointy shape.

Influence Width:
    #id: curvemaskwidth
    Scales the falloff handles around the effect position for additional
    control.

Curve Mask Ramp:
    #id: curvemaskramp
    Controls the curve mask directly.



Source Mode:
    #id: sourcemode

    Groom Object:
	Load the groom from a groom object.

    Groom File:
	Load the groom from a file.

Groom Object:
    #id: sourcegroomobject

    Load the groom data from this source object.

Groom File:
    #id: sourcegroomfile

    Load the groom data from this file.

== Skin VDB == (skinvdb)

Options for generating or loading a VDB representation of the skin geometry.
Many of the tools typically used within the Guide Groom object rely on this VDB
volume to efficiently avoid skin penetration.

VDB Source:
    #id: vdbsource

    From Skin Geometry:
	Generate the VDB from the specified skin geometry.

    SOP Geometry:
	Merge the VDB from a SOP.

    File:
	Load the VDB from a file.

Parameters for __From Skin Geometry__:

Voxel Size:
    #id: voxelsize

    Generate a VDB Volume of the skin geometry using this voxel size.

    The volume is used by SOP nodes to push curves out of the skin geometry.

Parameters for __SOP Geometry__ mode:

SOP Path:
    #id: vdbsop

    Merge the skin VDB from this SOP Path.

Group:
    #id: vdbsopgroup

    The group within the SOP geometry to use.

Parameters for __File__ mode:

File:
    #id: vdbfile

    Load the skin VDB from this file path.

Group:
    #id: vdbfilegroup

    The group within the file to use.

TIP:
    If the SOP or file contains multiple volumes, use `@name==surface` to fetch
    the surface VDB only, since this is the only volume used by the grooming
    tools.
