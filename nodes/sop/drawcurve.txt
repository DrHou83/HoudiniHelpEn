"""Creates a curve based on user input in the viewport."""

The Draw Curve allows freehand drawing of curves in the viewport. Different projection options allow the curve to be snapped to either a construction plane or a collision geometry. 

NOTE:
    Drawing with a stylus input device will account for pressure and tilt.
        
This tool uses the [Stroke SOP|Node:sop/stroke] internally.

@parameters

== Curve ==
Create Width Attribute:
    Creates an attribute named `width` containing the curve's radius.

    When this is disabled, the __Radius__ parameter is used only as the display
    size of the viewport brush.

Radius:
    Radius of the curve.

Tool:
    When __Create Stroke Attributes__ is enabled, this is stored as integer
    primitive attribute `stroke_tool` on each curve. It can be used by tools
    based on this node to take different actions for each curve.

Create Color Attribute:
    Create a primitive color attribute.

Color:
    Color of the curve.

Create Stroke Attributes:
    Creates attributes containing detailed information about the recorded strokes.

    See the [Stroke SOP|Node:sop/stroke] for more information.

Opacity:
    Opacity of the curve.

== Projection ==

Live Reprojection:
    None:
        Projection is only done at drawing stage.
        
    Send Rays:
        Reproject by resending rays on underlying changing collision geometry.
        
    Use UVs:
        Use the uv coordinates from the initial projection on changing collision geometry.

Trim Curves:
    Delete parts of drawn curves that don't hit any collision geometry.

Projection:
    XY/YZ/ZX/Screen Plane:
        Projection of the curve is done on specified orthographic plane.
    Geometry:
        Projection is done on the collision geometry that is plugged into first input.                       
Projection Center:
    Center of the orthographic projection plane.
