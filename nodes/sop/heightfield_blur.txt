"""Blurs a terrain height field or mask."""

This node smooths out value differences across a height field or mask, reducing contrast and spreading out features.

@parameters

Blur Layer:
    #id: layer
    
    The name of the volume to blur, usually `height` or `mask`.

[Include:_heightfield_common#masklayer]

Mask Aware Blur:
    #id: maskaware

    In some cases, applying a blur along a mask can cause sharp changes at the boundary of the mask. __Mask Aware Blur__ adjusts the blur radius by the mask to avoid discontinuities.

Iterations:
    #id: iterations

    Higher values mean a smoother surface, but take longer to calculate. To get the equivalent of twice the blur radius, you need four times the number of iterations.

Method:
    #id: method
    
    How to blur the input values.
    
    Blur:
        Gaussian blur.
        
    Box Blur:
        Faster blur.

    Expand:
        Instead of blurring, do a constant expansion of voxel values.
        
    Shrink:
        Instead of blurring do a constant contraction of voxel values.
    
Radius:
    #id: radius
    
    The amount of blurring/expansion/shrinkage (depending on the __Method__), in meters.
    
Override Border:
    #id: bordertype
    
    How to handle blurring areas outside the edges of the volume,
    
    Use Volume:
        Use the border property set on the volume being blurred. You can set the border property on a layer using the [Heightfield Layer Property|Node:sop/heightfield_layerproperty] node.
        
    Constant:
        Act as if grid points outside the volume were set to the value in __Border value__ below.
        
    Repeat:
        Act as if grid points outside the volume repeated (tiled) values inside the volume.
        
    Streak:
        Act as if the values at each border point continued outward outside the volume.
    
Border Value:
    #id: borderval
    
    When __Override border__ is "constant", the value to use for grid points outside the volume.
