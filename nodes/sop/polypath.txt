"""Cleans up topology of polygon curves."""

== Overview ==

This node replaces all edges with polygon curves that continue until any point connected to three or more other points is reached.
By default, this will reduce any edges that occur more than once to a single edge, and will remove any edges from a point to itself.
It also has various options for cleaning up topology in other ways.

@parameters

Connect End Points:
    #id: connectends

    When enabled, any points that share an edge with only one other point, "end points", will be connected to any points within __Max Distance__ by rewiring vertices onto the lowest-numbered of the points.  If __Connect Only To Other End Points__ is enabled, end points will not be connected to non-end points.

Max Distance:
    #id: maxendptdist

    When __Connect End Points__ is enabled, this specifies the farthest distance away that end points will be connected to other points.

Connect Only To Other End Points:
    #id: connectonlytoends

    When __Connect End Points__ is enabled and this is is enabled, end points will not be connected to non-end points.  This is useful if you just want to connect loose ends to each other.

Make Isolated Loops Closed:
    #id: closeloops

    When enabled, if any resulting polygon curves are loops that have no other curves connected to them, these open polygons (curves) will be changed to closed polygons (surfaces).
