"""Provides a simple Bullet simulation for testing the behavior of a ragdoll."""

This asset contains a simple Bullet simulation for use while setting up the [collision geometry|Node:sop/agentcollisionlayer] and [joint limits|Node:sop/agentconfigurejoints] of a ragdoll.
This can be used to quickly observe how the ragdoll behaves under different settings.

@parameters

== Ragdoll ==

    Display Collision Layer:
        Sets the agent's current layer to be the same as its collision layer.
        This can be used to visualize the collision geometry used by the solver.

    Number of Substeps:
        Specifies the number of substeps to be used by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

    Constraint Iterations:
        Specifies the number of constraint solver iterations to be used by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

    Initial Velocity:
        The initial velocity of the ragdoll.

    Initial Angular Velocity:
        The initial angular velocity of the ragdoll.

    Enable Gravity:
        Controls whether gravity is enabled.
        Disabling gravity can be useful when debugging situations where agents are initially violating their rotation limits.

    Gravity:
        Specifies the acceleration due to gravity.

    Ground Plane Position:
        The translation of the ground plane.

    Ground Plane Rotation:
        The rotation of the ground plane.
