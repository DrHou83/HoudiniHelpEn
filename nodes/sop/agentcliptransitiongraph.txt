@parameters

Units:
    The units for which time parameters are specified. This can be frames (at the Houdini FPS) or samples (in the clip's sample rate).

Compute Transition Graph:
    Automatically build a transition graph for the agent's animation clips.
    For each pair of clips, this searches for groups of consecutive frames where the agent's poses are similar.

Tolerance:
    Specifies a tolerance for how similar the agent's poses must be.

Blend Frames:
    Specifies the length of the transitions between animation clips.

Transform Group:
    When comparing pairs of poses, the comparison can be limited to a particular [group|Node:sop/agenttransformgroup] of transforms from the agent's rig (such as the lower body).

Filters:
    Restricts the pairs of clips to search for transition points between.
    The standard pattern matching syntax (such as that used by the [Vex:match] VEX function) can be used to specify multiple source and destination clips.

    For example, to exclude transitions from a `sit_to_stand` clip to the `sit` clip, and only search for transitions to the `stand_1` and `stand_2` clips, __Clip A__ could be set to `sit_to_stand` and __Clip B__ could be set to `stand_*`.

Extra Transitions:
    The number of additional transitions to set up between pairs of animation clips.

Clip A:
    The name of the animation clip to transition from.

Clip B:
    The name of the animation clip to transition to.

Initialize from Computed Transition Regions:
    Sets the transition region parameters to the computed values if __Compute Transition Graph__ is enabled.
    This can be used to perform manual edits to the computed transition regions.

Transition Regions:
    The number of regions in the clip where a transition may occur.

Sync Frame A:
    Specifies a frame in __Clip A__ where the pose is similar to __Sync Frame B__ in __Clip B__.

Transition Region:
    Specifies the range of frames where a transition may begin. This should typically include __Sync Frame A__.

Sync Frame B:
    Specifies a frame in __Clip B__ where the pose is similar to __Sync Frame A__ in __Clip A__.

Blend Frames:
    Specifies the length of the transition between the clips.
