"""Populates a crowd of agent primitives."""

== Overview ==

This node takes two inputs:

* The first input contains one or more agent primitives to use when populating the crowd, as created by an [agent setup network|/crowds/setup#agent].

* The optional second input can contain either a point cloud or a surface.

    * If the second input contains a point cloud, an agent primitive will be placed at each point position.

    * If the second input contains a surface, agent primitives will be scattered across the surface.

    * If the second input is not connected, agent primitives will be scattered within the boundary defined by the __Area Size__ parameter.

== Using multiple agent types  ==

The first input can contain multiple agent types. You can use the following methods to control which agent types are created in the crowd:

* On the __Randomize__ tab, turn on __Randomize Agent Primitive__ to have the node randomly assign different agent types to each point.

* The geometry in the second input can have an `agent_id` attribute that specifies the primitive number of an agent from the first input to use at each point. Alternatively, the `agentname` point attribute can be used to specify the name of an agent (such as `mocapbiped3`) from the first input to use at each point.

If you don't use __Randomize Agent Primitive__ or the `agent_id` attribute, the node only creates agents using primitive `0` from the first input.

@attributes

When the second input contains a point cloud, the following attributes can be used to control how agents are created and placed on the points.

`agentcollisionlayer`:
    #type: string
    #on: point

    The agent's collision layer will be set to the layer with this name, if the value is not empty.

`agentcurrentlayer`:
    #type: string
    #on: point

    The agent's current layer will be set to the layer with this name.
    If the value of the point attribute is empty, the agent's current layer will be left as-is unless __Randomize Current Layer__ is enabled.

`agentname`:
    #type: string
    #on: point

    Specifies the name of an agent from the first input to use at this point.

`agent_id`:
    #type: int
    #on: point

    Specifies the primitive number of an agent from the first input to use at this point.

`state`:
    #type: string
    #on: point

    Specifies the initial state that the agent will be in.
    If the value is empty, the agent's state will be set using the __Initial State__ and __Randomize Initial State__ parameters.

== Randomize ==

    Use the controls on this tab to randomize different attributes of the agents in the crowd. Turning on a checkbox shows controls for that type of randomization.

    Randomize Agent Primitive:
        Randomly chooses an agent type from the first input for each agent in the crowd. This lets you populate the crowd with more than one type of agent.
        If geometry is provided for the second input, the `agent_id` or `agentname` point attribute can also be used to specify which agent primitive from the input geometry should be copied to each point.
