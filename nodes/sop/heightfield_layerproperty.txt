"""Sets the border voxel policy on a height field volume."""

Each height field layer has a property controlling how operations should affect voxels at the edge of the volume. This node lets you set the property for a given layer.

This is important when tiling height fields into a larger height field map, or merging a smaller height field into a larger height field.


@parameters

Layer:
    #id: layer
    
    The name of the layer to set the border property on, usually `height`.
    
Adjust Border:
    #id: doborder
    
    Actually change the border property. If this is off the node does nothing.
    
Border Type:
    #id: border
    
        
    Constant:
        Act as if grid points outside the volume are set to the value in __Border value__ below.
        
    Repeat:
        Act as if grid points outside the volume repeat (tile) values inside the volume.
        
    Streak:
        Act as if the values at each border point continue outward outside the volume.
        
    SDF:
        Not useful for height fields.
    
Border Value:
    #id: borderval
    
    When __Border type__ is "constant", the value to use for grid points outside the volume.
