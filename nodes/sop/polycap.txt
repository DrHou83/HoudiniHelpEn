"""Fills in polygons between boundary edges."""

== Using PolyCap ==
                
# Select the edges of the polygon you want to cap.
            
    You can select one edge and press ((L)) to loop forward and select all edges. Additionally, pressing ((R)) reverses the direction of the arrow and pressing ((F)) marches the selection forward once an edge is selected.
                    
# Click the [Icon:SOP/polycap][PolyCap|/nodes/sop/polyreduce] tool on the __Polygon__ tab.

NOTE:
     The cap is automatically fused to the polygon; however, there is an option to turn on the _Unique Points_ checkbox in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

@parameters

Group:
    A list of boundary edges with which to create caps.

Cap all unshared edges if no group:
    If the __Group__ field is empty, create caps across all boundary loops in the input geometry.
    Turn this off if you want an empty __Group__ list to do nothing.

Reverse Caps:
    Reverse the orientation of the created caps.

Triangulate Caps:
    Construct the caps using only triangles.

Unique Points:
    Create caps with their own points.

Update Point Normals:
    Recompute point normals, if they exist.
