= Agent Terrain Adaptation =

"""Adapts agents' legs to conform to terrain and prevent the feet from sliding."""

This node is used to modify the transforms of agents' leg bones to avoid intersection with terrain and prevent the feet from sliding.
Terrain adaptation may also be done during a [crowd simulation|Node:dop/agentterrainadaptation], but this SOP can be used, for example, to adapt a cached crowd simulation to new terrain.

@parameters

Group:
    Specifies a group of agents that this node should affect.

Enable Simulation:
    Some optional features (such as foot locking and leaning) require access to the state of the agents on the previous frame.
    As a result, an embedded DOP network is used to implement the terrain adaptation.
    If this parameter is disabled, those features will also be disabled and the SOP will not require simulation.
    This can be useful for quickly producing a rough preview of the final terrain adaptation results.

Set Up Vector to Terrain Normal:
    Updates the up vector to match the terrain normal. This requires that __Enable Terrain Projection__ is enabled.
    This may be useful for situations such as insects crawling on walls.
