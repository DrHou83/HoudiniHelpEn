= VDB Topology to SDF =

"""Creates an SDF VDB based on the active set of another VDB."""


The VDB Topology to SDF node creates an SDF VDB which wraps the active
set of the reference VDB.  This forms a shell or wrapper that can be used
to conservatively enclose the referenced VDB.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    The VDBs to consider for conversion.
    
    
Output Name:
    #id: outputname

    The pattern used to generate new names from the input VDBs.
    
Custom Name:
    #id: customname

    The unique name used either for the new VDB, or as the suffix.
    
    
Use World Space for Band:
    #id: worldspaceunits

    The generated SDF can have its bandwidth provided in voxels or in SOP space.
    
    
Half-Band in Voxels:
    #id: bandwidth

    Specifies the bandwidth in voxel space.  This is most efficient as it will work with all scales of geometry.  3 voxels is optimal for many level set operations.
    
    
Half-Band in World:
    #id: bandwidthws
    
    The halfband of the SDF measured in SOP space.
    
Voxel Dilation:
    #id: dilation
    
    Expands the filled voxel region by the specified number of voxels.  This will provide this much additional padding.
    
Closing Width:
    #id: closingwidth

    First expand the filled voxel region, then shrink it by the specified number of voxels. This causes holes and valleys to be filled.
    
    
Smoothing Steps:
    #id: smoothingsteps
    
    Number of smoothing iterations.
