"""Converts a 2D height field to a 3D VDB volume, polygon surface, or polygon soup surface."""


@parameters

Height Layer:
    #id: layer
    #contentfrom: _heightfield_common#heightlayer
    
Convert to:
    #id: conversion
    
    Polygon:
        Convert the height values stored in the grid to a polygonal surface.
        
    Polygon Soup:
        Like "Polygon", but outputs a [polygon soup|/model/primitives#polysoup] surface. Polygon soups are more efficient representations of dense polygonal geometry, but do not allow most editing operations.
        
    VDB:
        Convert the height values to a 3D VDB volume. Note that this representation takes a lot more memory than a height field.
    
Connectivity:
    #id: surftype
    
    How to lay out the polygons when __Convert to__ is "Polygon" or "Polygon soup". "Rows", "Columns", and "Rows and columns" are probably not useful for terrain data.
    
Density:
    #id: lod
    
    A ratio between output resolution and grid points in the source height field. For example, a value of `0.5` will output half the resolution (one polygon for every four voxels in the source), a value of `2` will output twice the resolution (four polygons for ever one voxel in the source).

Bake Point Colors:
    #id: bakecd

    Creates point colours using any heightfield material present on the geometry.  This provides a close approximation for the output of HeightField Visualization or HeightField Erode.

== Extrusion ==

Extrude Base:
    #id: doextrude
    
    Whether to include an extruded base when outputting polygons. VDB output always includes the base.
    
Depth:
    #id: depth
    
    The height of the base.
    
Base Normal:
    #id: basenormal
    
    The direction of the normals created for the base.

Flatten Base:
    #id: flat
    
    Flattens the base. If you turn this off, the bottom of the extrusion has the same shape as the top, creating an extruded surface effect.
    
    :col:
        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/convertheightfield_flatten_on.jpg]
    
        Flatten on, depth -1.
    
    :col:
        [Image:/images/nodes/sop/convertheightfield_flatten_off.jpg]
    
        Flatten off, depth -20.
