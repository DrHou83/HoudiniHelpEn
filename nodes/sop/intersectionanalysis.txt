"""Creates points with attributes at intersections between a triangle and/or curve mesh with itself, or with an optional second set of triangles and/or curves."""

This low-level node can be used to build higher-level tools dealing with intersecting geometry, such as the [Boolean node|Node:sop/boolean]. If you just want to intersect geometry or output intersections in a more usable format, use [Boolean|Node:sop/boolean].

The node outputs a point at each intersection with attributes identifying the origin of the intersection. It does not pipe through the input geometry. You can control which attributes the node creates on the points using the __Input number__, __Primitive number__, __Primitive UVW__, and __Point num__ parameters.


@inputs

* If you connect one input, the node finds self-intersections in the input.

* If you connect the first and second input, the node finds intersections between the two models.


@parameters

Group A:
    A list of primitives to check from the first input. If this is blank, the node checks all primitives.

Group B:
    A list of primitives to check from the second input. If this is blank, the node checks all primitives.


== Output attributes ==

Turn on the checkbox next to a parameter to create the attribute on the output points. You can use the text boxes to change the names of the attributes.

Input Number:
    #id: inputnumattrib

    Add an attribute indicating which input (0 or 1) the intersected primitive belongs to.

Primitive Number:
    #id: primnumattrib

    Add an attribute indicating the numbers of primitives incident to the intersection point.

Primitive UVW:
    #id: primuvwattrib

    Add an attribute indicating the coordinates of the intersection point in the parameter space of the primitive on which it was generated.

Point Num:
    #id: ptnumattrib
    
    Add an attribute indicating the point numbers of points incident to the intersection point.
