"""Extracts a square of a certain width/length from a larger height volume, or resizes/moves the boundaries of the height field."""

* If you set __Crop mode__ to "Intersect", the node acts like a cropping tool, removing parts of the height field outside the new boundaries.

* If you specify new boundaries outside or overlapping the original boundaries:

     * If __Crop mode__ is "Intersect", the output will not extend beyond the original boundaries. (If the boxes do not overlap at all, the node will output a 1x1 height field instead of an empty volume.)
     
     * If __Crop mode__ is "Replace", the output uses the new boundaries and areas outside the original boundaries are filled using the boundary extension policy. This is useful for moving a "window" onto a larger height field through world space.
     
     * If __Crop mode__ is "Union", the output uses the bounding box of the original and new boundaries, and any areas outside the original boundaries are filled using the boundary extension policy. This is useful for changing the size of the height field canvas in world space.

     (You can set the border extension policy (__Border type__) on a height field using the [Heightfield Layer Property node|Node:sop/heightfield_layerproperty].)


@parameters

Crop Mode:
    #id: cropmode
    
    "Intersect" sets the boundaries to the intersection of the original and the box specified below. "Replace" sets the boundaries to the box specified below. "Union" set the boundaries to the bounding box of the original and the box specified below.
    
Crop Mask Layer:
    #id: cropbylayer
    
    Crop to the bounding box of this mask layer.

Keep Where Below Crop Value:
    #id: keepbelow
    
    If __Crop Mask Layer__ is not empty, only consider mask values above a certain minimum when computing the bounding box of the mask.

Crop Value:
    #id: cropvalue
    
    The minimum mask value to consider when __Crop mask layer__ and __Keep where below crop value__ are one.

Orientation:
    #id: orient
    
    The orientation of the cropped region. Disabled when __Crop mask layer__ is on.
    
Size:
    #id: size
    
    The width and length of the cropped region. Disabled when __Crop mask layer__ is on.
    
Center:
    #id: t
    
    The center of the tile where the cropping will occur. Disabled when __Crop mask layer__ is on.
    
Voxel Padding:
    #id: voxelpad
    
    Number of extra voxels added to the width and height for padding.
