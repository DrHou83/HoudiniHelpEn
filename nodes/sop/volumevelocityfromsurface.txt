= Volume Velocity from Surface =

"""Generates a velocity field within a surface geometry."""

The direction of the flow field is controlled by setting varying divergence on the surface geometry.

The velocity field is computed via pressure projection and flows away from high divergence areas to low divergence areas.

@parameters

== Velocity Volume ==

Use OpenCL:
    #id: opencl

    Use OpenCL to run the pressure solve.

Voxel Size:
    #id: voxelsize

    The voxel size to use for the velocity volume.

Exterior Band:
    #id: exteriorband

    The width of the outer region around the surface to generate velocities for. This also has an influence on the field generated inside the geometry.

Pressure Solve Iterations:
    #id: pressureiters

    Number of iterations to run the pressure solve for.

Velocity Volume:
    #id: velname

    The name of the computed velocity volume.

Output Collision Volume:
    #id: outputcoll

    Output the computed collision volume.

Collision Volume:
    #id: velname

    The name of the computed collision volume.

== Divergence ==

Divergence Attribute:
    #id: divattrib

    Use this existing attribute on the surface geometry for divergence values.

=== Divergence Groups ===

    Set divergence values for surface geometry groups.

Enable:
    #id: divgroupenable#

    Enable this divergence group.

Group Type:
    #id: divgrouptype#

    The type of geometry group.

Group:
    #id: divgroup#

    The group to set divergence values for.

Divergence:
    #id: divvalue#

    The divergence value to set for this group.
