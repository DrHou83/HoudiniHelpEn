== Collision Resolution ==

Collide With Skin:
    #id: collidewithskin

    Resolve collisions with the Skin VDB in addition to any VDBs from the 4th
    input.

Surface Offset:
    #id: isooffset

    Offset the isosurface of the VDB volumes.

Push Range:
    #id: pushrange

    In addition to resolving curves that penetrate the skin, push curves within
    this distance of the VDB away from the surface.

Push Amount:
    #id: pushamount

    Push curves by this distance.
