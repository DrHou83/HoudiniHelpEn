= Block Begin Compile =

"""The start of a compile block."""

The Block Begin Compile works in concert with the [Block End Compile|Node:sop/compile_end] to separate part of a node network from the rest of the graph.

Block Begin Compiles form the input into compiled block and mark the transition from normal SOP cooking into the compiled subgraph.

NOTE:
    This node will rarely be explicitly placed.  Instead, the __Compile Block__ tab menu entry will generate a pair of block nodes in a single operation.

@parameters

Block Path:
    #id: blockpath

    The path to the [Block End Compile|Node:sop/compile_end] representing the end of the compiled sub-graph.
    
Input Name:
    Each of the inputs of a compiled block may be assigned a name to allow
    external users of the compiled block to replace the wired input with
    their own data.  This is used by the [Invoke|Node:sop/invoke] and
    the [SOP Solver|Node/dop/sopsolver::2.0].
    
Create Block Begin Node:
    #id: createbeginblock

    Creates a clone of this node with the appropriate block path setup.
