"""Supports Deform by assigning capture weights to points based on biharmonic functions on tetrahedral meshes."""

This node creates captures weights on geometry that is to be deformed by the
[Node:sop/deform] SOP. They are computed using biharmonic functions on the
tetrahedral mesh specified from the second input.

The weights are solved using constraints specified on the tetrahedral mesh
points by way of the `boneCapture` attribute. Points which have no assigned
weights are treated as values to be solved. The suggested setup for generating
such a tetrahedral mesh from the skin geometry is to use a
[Node:sop/solidconform] SOP with the skin geometry in its first input and a
[Node:sop/bonecapturelines] SOP as its second input. For high resolution skin
meshes, it's suggested to use [Node:sop/solidembed] instead of
[Node:sop/solidconform] with __Enlarge to Cover Input Mesh__ turned off.

After the weights are computed on the tetrahedral mesh, they are then
transferred to the points specified from the first input (which typically
contains polygonal geometry).

@parameters

Group:
    Optional point group from the first input to capture. Default behavior is
    to capture all points when this value is empty.

Max Iterations:
    The maximum number of iterations when solving for the weights. Using a
    large number of max iterations will allow the solver to converge to a
    higher quality solution at the expense of speed. Since biharmonic functions
    for capture weights do not usually need to be very precise, a low number of
    max iterations often produces suitable results.

Destroy Existing Weights:
    Destroy any existing capture weights.

Blend Factor:
    If destroy existing weights is off, then this parameter determines the
    blend factor of the created capture weights with the existing ones.

Point Coloring:
    Adds point color attributes to show the weighting of the points. The color
    of each point will be a blend of the colors of its captured regions.

Zero Weight Point Color:
    Color used for points with zero weight.

== Diagnostics ==

Output Capture Tets:
    If on, it outputs the tet mesh from the second input (instead of the first
    input) with the solved weights for debugging purposes.

Verify:
    If on, it verifies internal matrices and prints solver specific information
    to the standard output for debugging purposes. An error will be added if
    bad tets are found.
