= Volume Patch =

"""Fill in a region of a volume with features from another volume."""

The Volume Patch operation takes a background volume, a foreground volume, and a mask. It outputs a volume that is exactly the background volume outside of the mask, but fills in the masked region with features from the foreground volume while ensuring a continuous boundary.

The output has the same name as the background group.

[Include:no_vdb]

@parameters
Background Group:
	The volume primitive to be used outside of the masked region.

Foreground Group:
	The volume primitives whose features will be used to fill holes in the background.

Mask:
	The volume primitive indicating which regions in the background should be filled in with features from the foreground.

Cutoff for Mask:
	The operation will apply to regions with a mask value which is at least this value.

Use Foreground as Laplacian:
	An advanced setting. Instead of filling in the masked region with a volume similar to the second input, fill in the region with a surface that has Laplacian equal to the second input. The [Volume Analysis SOP|Node:sop/volumeanalysis] can be used to obtain a Laplacian, which can then be modified and used in this node for more complex fill effects (for example, multiplying the Laplacian by an edge detector creates a terrace effect).
