= Guide Initialize =

"""Quickly give hair guides some initial direction."""

This node is useful to get started with a groom quickly. It provides multiple
methods of directing the entire groom.


@parameters

Wind Amount:
    #id: windamount

    Amount of wind to simulate. Higher values point hair more in the __Wind
    Direction__ below.

Wind Direction:
    #id: winddir

    Point guide curves in this direction when using wind.

Tangential to Skin:
    #id: alongskin

    Wrap wind around the skin, causing guide curves to stick more to the skin
    in areas where the wind direction would otherwise point it away from the
    skin.

UV Blend:
    #id: uvblend

    Point guide curves in the direction of increasing UV values.

UV Rotation:
    #id: uvrot

    Rotate the used UV direction. This can be used to correct a difference
    between UV layout and the desired guide direction.

Lift:
    #id: lift

    Lift hairs off the skin by this minimum amount.
