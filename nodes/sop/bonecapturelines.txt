= Bone Capture Lines =

"""Supports Bone Capture Biharmonic by creating lines from bones with suitable attributes."""

This node is used to create line geometry with suitable capture attributes that
are used for setups when using the [Node:sop/bonecapturebiharmonic] SOP. It
generates the lines by looking at [Capture Region|Node:sop/cregion] primitives
that can be specified from either the geometry of the (optional) first input
and/or from parameter values.

The special behavior for this node includes:
    - Merging overlapping line segments into polygonal curves
    - Creates attributes understood by the [Node:sop/deform] and [Node:sop/bonecapturebiharmonic] SOPs: `pCaptFrame`, `pCaptSkelRoot`, and `boneCapture`

The typical setup for using this node is for use as the second input of the
[Node:sop/solidconform] SOP to create a tetrahedral mesh that can be used with
[Node:sop/bonecapturebiharmonic].

NOTE:
    The points of the lines do not include the end caps of the capture region
    primitives.

@parameters

Hierarchy:
    Top of the object hierarchy traversed for the Capture Region operations.

Extra Regions:
    The list of paths to extra bone objects or capture regions to be used
    separated by spaces. This list is appended to what the Hierarchy parameter
    specifies.

Resample Segments:
    Specifies how the lines should be resampled.

    Off: 
	    No resampling.
    By Max Axis Fraction:
	    Resample using a maximum segment length derived from __Max Axis Fraction__ multiplied by the largest axis of the lines' bounding box.
    By Max Segment Length:
	    Resample using the __Max Segment Length__ value.

Max Axis Fraction:
    The fraction of the largest axis of the lines' bounding box side to use for resampling. This is only used when __Resample Segments__ is set to __Max Axis Fraction__.

Max Segment Length:
    When when __Resample Segments__ is set to __Max Segment Length__, this specifies the maximum line segment length to resample with.

Exclude Short Bones:
    When enabled, bones whose lengths are equal or less than __Exclude Threshold__ will be ignored.

Exclude Threshold:
    When __Exclude Short Bones__ is enabled, bones whose lengths are equal or less than this value are ignored.

Fuse Threshold:
    The threshold at which points will be fused in the output. A tolerance is
    computed from this value by multiplying it with the maximum bounding box
    axis size. Points whose positions are equal or less than the tolerance will
    be fused into a single point.

Use Bone Link:
    Generate segments using the center line of the bone link instead of its capture region.

== Capture Options ==

Use Capture Pose:
    If turned on, the capture parameters of bones and capture regions are used.
    This means that the output will be capture frame independent. The capture
    pose can be viewed by choosing
    __Edit > Objects > Bone Kinematic Override: Capture Pose__
    from the main menu.

Cook at:
    Specify when this node is allowed to cook.

Capture Frame:
    Frame number at which to get evaluate the capture parameters.

Force Cook:
    Forces the operation to recook immediately.

== Hierarchy Options ==

Region SOP:
    Specifies the geometry in which to find the Capture Regions.

Traverse into subnets:
    If turned on, when traversing the hierarchy for capture regions, also traverse inside object subnets.

Create Relative Skeleton Root Path:
    If on, the internal cregion paths are generated with a skeleton path prefix (`pCaptSkelRoot` attribute value) that is relative to this SOP. If off, the prefix is determined by the longest common object path prefix out of all the capture region paths.
