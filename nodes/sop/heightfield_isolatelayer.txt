"""Copies another layer over the mask layer, and optionally flattens the height field."""

TIP:
    The [Height Field Visualize|Node:sop/heightfield_visualize] node has better controls for visualizing mask layers.

Houdini supports a default visualization for height fields that shows the `height` field as a 3D surface and the `mask` field as a red tint on the surface.

This node simply copies a given layer into the mask layer or the height layer, to let you use the default visualization to visualize a different layer (for example, the `mesa` mask layer created by [Heightfield Clip|Node:sop/heightfield_clip]).

WARNING:
    The output of this node is the height field and mask you see in the viewport. That means it changes the `mask` layer, and if you turn on __Overwrite height__, it zeroes the `height` field.
    
    If you are using this node to visualize a layer, you should *branch it off the network and not use its output*.
    
    You could theoretically use the output of this node if you just want to copy another layer into the height field or mask, but you should probably use the appropriate dedicated node ([Heightfield Copy Layer|Node:sop/heightfield_copylayer]) instead to make the network more understandable.


@parameters

Layer to Isolate:
    #id: layer
    
    The name of the layer to copy into the `mask` layer.

Overwrite Height:

    Replace the existing height field with the isolated layer. This 

Overwrite Mask:
    #id: overwritemask
