"""Lets you paint values into a height or mask field using strokes."""

* The "FG" and "BG" parameters let you assign different values to strokes made with ((LMB)) and ((MMB)).

    It is often useful to use ((MMB)) as "erase". For example, if __Paint method__ is "Replace", you might set __FG value__ to `50` and __BG value__ to `0`, so ((LMB)) sets the height and ((MMB)) clears it.
    
    Or if __Paint method__ is "Add", you might set __FG value__ to `50` and __BG value__ to `-50`, so ((LMB)) adds height and ((MMB)) removes it.

* Updating the display can be slow with high-resolution volumes, and the stroke may drop points. You may need to draw slowly to capture finely detailed strokes.

* The node caches the incoming volumes for speed. If you change something upstream, you need to click __Recache strokes__ to re-apply the existing strokes to the changed volumes, otherwise this node's display won't reflect the upstream changes.


@parameters

Reset Strokes:
    #id: reset
    
    Click to clear all strokes in this node.

Recache Strokes:
    #id: recache
    
    Re-cache the input volumes and re-apply any existing strokes.

Layer:
    #id: stroke_layer
    
    The name of the layer to paint into, for example `height` or `mask`.

Tint by Current Layer:
    Apply an implicit heightfield visualization to change the tint layer
    to tint white-to-red the current stroke layer.
    
Paint Method:
    #id: stroke_method
    #contentfrom: _heightfield_common#combine
    
FG Value:
    #id: fgvalue 
    
    The maximum value for strokes made with ((LMB)). For masks this would usually be `1`, or for the height layer the highest peak you want to be able to make or the most you want to be able to add/subtract/etc at once. Pressure sensitive input can scale this value down.
    
BG Value:
    #id: bgvalue
    
    The maximum value for strokes made with ((MMB)).
    
Opacity:
    #id: stroke_opacity.
    
    A scale on the FG value. This can be useful to drag into the viewport as a [HUD slider|/basics/hud_sliders] so you can adjust the strength of each stroke on the fly, especially if you don't have a pressure sensitive input device.

Radius:
    #id: stroke_radius
    
    The maximum radius of strokes. Pressure sensitive input can scale this value down.

Opacity Pressure:
    Scales the effect of stylus pressure on opacity. 

Radius Pressure:
    Scales the effect of stylus pressure on brush radius. 


== Strokes ==

[Include:_heightfield_common#stroke_projtype]
    
Stroke Quality:
    #id: quality
    
    The sampling rate of the brush stroke. Higher values can capture more detail but use more memory and are slower to display.   
    
Live Application:
    #id: livemode
    
    Keep strokes active and do not cache.
