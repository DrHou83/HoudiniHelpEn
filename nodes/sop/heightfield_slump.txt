"""Simulates loose material sliding down inclines and piling at the bottom."""

A slump is a form of mass wasting that occurs when a coherent mass of loosely consolidated materials or rock layers moves a short distance down a slope. Slumping is when a unstable pile of rubble settles into a more stable configuration, often bounded by its angle of repose.

Whereas [Height Field Erode|Node:sop/heightfield_erode] simulates erosion be iterating over animation frames, this node calculates and applies the effect of slumping all at once.


@parameters

== Slump ==

Spread Iterations:
    #id: iterations
    
    How many iterations of slumping to simulate.

Spread Rate:
    #id: spread_rate
    
    How fast material spreads across the terrain in each iteration.

Repose Angle:
    #id: repose_angle
    
    The maximum slope, measured in degrees from the horizontal, at which loose solid material will remain in place without sliding.

Height Factor:
    #id: height_factor
    
    Scales the height field before slumping. This increases contrast in the slumping.
    
Entrainment Rate:
    #id: entrainment
    
    Entrainment is process of material lifting by an agent of erosion. This controls the percentage of the entrained material that is dragged with the slumping material in each iteration.

Allow Material Outflow:
    #id: openborder
    
    When material moves beyond the edge of the heightfield, it is erased. Turning this off causes the material to accumulate at the edges.
    
Add to Bedrock:
    #id: add_to_bedrock
    
    Place material back into the bedrock (height layer) for further calculations such as erosion.


== Flow Field ==

Calculate Flow Fields:
    #id: flow_enable
    
    Add new fields to the output containing information on the cumulative and average flow directions.
    
Smoothing Iterations:
    #id: flow_smooth_iters
    
    When greater than 0, smooths the contents of the flow layers. Higher values do more smoothing.
    
Smoothing Rate:
    #id: flow_smooth_rate
    
    A scale on the effect of smoothing in each iteration.


== Bindings ==

~~~ Input Layers ~~~

Bedrock:
    #id: bedrocklayer
    
    Name of the field to use as bedrock in the slumping simulation. Default is `height`.
    
Material to Slump:
    #id: materiallayer
    
    Mask field marking on which parts of the heightfield to simulate slumping. Default is `mask`.
    
Entrained Material:
    #id: entrainedlayer
    
    If the input already has a debris layer from a previous [Heightfield Erode|Node:sop/heightfield_erode] you can put its name here and the algorithm will treat it as already-loose soil.

    
~~~ Output Layers ~~~

Flow:
    #id: flowlayer
    
    When __Calculate flow fields__ on the __Flow__ tab is on, the node outputs a `flow` layer representing the _cumulative_ material flow. This layer has two signed components (x and y) representing the flow direction in voxel space. Because this is cumulative, if material flows left, then flows right, those two motions will cancel and the x component would be 0.

Flow Dir Layer:
    #id: flowdirlayer
    
    When __Calculate flow fields__ on the __Flow__ tab is on, the node outputs a `flowdir` layer containing vectors showing the average direction of flow at each voxel.
