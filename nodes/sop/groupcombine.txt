"""Combines point groups, primitive groups, or edge groups according to boolean operations."""

== Overview ==

Group Combine creates new groups that are the boolean combination of
existing groups or ad hoc pattern groups.

@inputs

Source geometry:
    The geometry on which to create the groups.

@parameters

Number of Combines:
    The number of groups to create via combination rules.

Group Type:
    The type of group on which to operate. While it can usually
    be determined from the given groups, this parameter is
    useful to resolve ambiguous cases.
    
Group:
    This section allows you to create a new group out of existing groups. 
    Enter the group to operate on or create in the first field and the name of 
    the existing group in the field on the other side of the buttons. You can 
    either include the contents of the other group by selecting 
    __Equals__ or everything that is not the other 
    group by selecting __Equals All But__. Use 
    the fields below to combine additional groups.
