= Agent Collision Layer =

"""Creates a new agent layer that is suitable for collision detection."""

This node creates an agent layer that consists of simple static shapes such as capsules and boxes.
The resulting layer is suitable for use as an agent's collision layer.

@parameters

    Group:
        The agents to add the new layer to.
    Layer Name:
        The name of the new layer.
    Copy Source Layer:
        Specifies whether to use an existing layer as the starting point for the new layer. All of the shape bindings from the __Source Layer__ will be copied.
    Source Layer:
        If __Copy Source Layer__ is enabled, specifies the name of an existing layer to copy shape bindings from.

    [Include:/nodes/sop/agentlayer#keepexternalref]

    Set as Current Layer:
        Sets the current layer of each agent to the new layer.
    Set as Collision Layer:
        Sets the collision layer of each agent to the new layer.
    Configure RBD Properties Per Shape:
        Creates [array point attributes|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject#agentattributes] that provide the Bullet solver with per-shape values for physical properties such as friction and bounce.
        If this option is disabled, the parameters on the [Crowd Object DOP|Node:dop/crowdobject] or [RBD Packed Object DOP|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject] will apply to all of the agent's RBD objects.
    Collision Shapes:
        The number of collision shapes that should be added.
    Transform Name:
        Specifies which transform in the rig the shape should be attached to.
    Translate:
        Specifies the translation of the shape in local space.
    Rotate:
        Specifies the rotation of the shape about the xyz axes in local space.
    Scale:
        Specifies the size of the shape in local space.
    Pivot:
        Specifies the local pivot point for rotations.
    Shape:
        Specifies the type of primitive shape to create.
    SOP Path:
        Specifies the SOP geometry to use for the shape if the shape type is __Custom__.
    Keep Position When Attaching:
        When __Shape__ is __Custom__, specifies that the new shape should be transformed before being added to the shape library so that its current world position will be maintained after being attached to the __Transform Name__.

    Density:
        Specifies the shape's density when __Configure RBD Properties Per Shape__ is enabled. The mass of an object is its volume times its density.
    Rotational Stiffness:
        Specifies how liable the shape is to spin when __Configure RBD Properties Per Shape__ is enabled.
    Bounce:
        Specifies the object's elasticity when __Configure RBD Properties Per Shape__ is enabled.
    Friction:
        Specifies the object's coefficient of friction when __Configure RBD Properties Per Shape__ is enabled.

@inputs
    Agents:
        Agent primitives.

@outputs
    Agents:
        Agent primitives with additional layer and shapes.
