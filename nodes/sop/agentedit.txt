"""Edits properties of agent primitives."""

This node modifies the current layers, animation clips, and transforms of agent primitives.

@parameters

Group:
	The group of agent primitives to edit.

Set Current Layer:
	Sets the current layer of the agents. 

Set Collision Layer:
	Sets the collision layer of the agents.

Set Current Clip:
	Sets the current [animation clip|/crowds/clips] of the agents.

Clip Time:
	Sets the current time of an animation clip.

Clip Index:
        Specifies which of the agent's current clips the __Clip Time__ and __Set Current Clip__ parameters affect.

Adjust Transforms:
	Overrides specific transforms of the agent.

    Enable:
        Toggles whether the joint's transform is adjusted.

    Transform Name:
        Specifies the name of the joint to adjust.

    Space:
        Controls whether the transform parameters specify a transform in the local space of the joint, world space, or in the agent's space.

    Transform Order:
        Order in which transformations occur.

    Rotate Order:
        Order in which rotations occur.

    Translate:
        Amount of translation along xyz axes.

    Rotate:
        Amount of rotation about xyz axes.

    Scale:
        Non-uniform scaling along xyz axes.

    Pivot:
        Local pivot point for transformations.

@inputs

Agents:
	The packed agent primitives.

@outputs

Agents:
	The modified packed agent primitives.
