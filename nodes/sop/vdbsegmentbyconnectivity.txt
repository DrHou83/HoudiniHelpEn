= VDB Segment by Connectivity =

"""Splits SDF VDBs into connected components."""

A single SDF VDB may represent multiple disjoint objects.  This SOP attempts to detect disjoint components and create a VDB for each connected component.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    The VDBs to examine for connectivity.
    
    
Color Segments:
    #id: colorsegments

    Generated segments will be assigned random colors, allowing quick visual identification of segments.
    
    
Append Segment Number to Grid Name:
    #id: appendnumber

    The generated VDBs will have their segment number appended to their grid name, letting them be identified.
