@parameters

== General ==

Group Type:
    #id: grouptype

    The type of input group.

Group:
    #id: group

    A group to use for masking. Any operations will only be applied to the
    primitives or points within this group.

Blend:
    #id: blend

    [Include:fur_common#opblend]

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Operation:
    #id: operation

    Constrained Advection:
	Advect input curves through the velocity field, keeping the points and length
	of the original curve.

    Fill Collision Field:
	Regrow guide from their roots, constraining motion to collision field.
	Guides with roots outside of the collision volume are not affected.
	Advection is stopped when the magnitude of the velocity field is zero.

    Fill Velocity Field:
	Advect guides through the velocity field. Advection is stopped when the
	magnitude of the velocity field is zero.


Output Group of Affected Primitives:
    #id: outputaffectedgroup

    Create a group of guides affects by advection. This includes guides within
    the input group with blend values above zero and non-zero velocity at the
    root point.

Output Group:
    #id: affectedgroup

    The name of the group of affected guides.

Follow Skin:
    #id: followskin

    Makes the velocity field values tangential to the skin VDB in the 3rd input.

Sampling Quality:
    #id: samplingquality

    Controls the advection step size. At `1` the step size equals the voxel
    diameter of the velocity field.

Segment Mode:
    #id: segmode

    Keep Input Segment Count:
	Output curves with the same point count as the input curves.

    Adaptive:
	Resample curves to a given segment length.


Segment Length:
    #id: seglength
    The segment length to use when __Segment Mode__ is set to __Adaptive__.

== Collisions ==

Stop on Collision:
    #id: stoponcoll

    Stop advection when the collision field's isosurface is hit.

== Length ==

Limit Length:
    #id: limitlength

    Stop advection when a certain curve length is reached.


Length:
    #id: length

    The length to stop at.
