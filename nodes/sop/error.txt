"""Generates a message, warning, or error, which can show up on a parent asset."""

This node passes through the input geometry unchanged, but optionally generates a message, warning or error. If this node cooks inside an asset, the messages/warnings/errors will propagate up to the asset, letting you signal problems to the asset user.

For example, say you have a parameter that generates unusable results if it goes above 10. You could wire an Error node into the network, and set it to generate a warning with the __Report this error__ parameter set to an expression such as:

`../mynode/myparm > 10`

@parameters

Number of Errors:
    The number of notices to evaluate.

Error Message:
    The text to show to the user when this notice is active. If this is an empty string, the notice is not reported.

Severity:
    What kind of feedback this notice is. A "message" only shows up in the node info window. A "warning" shows a badge on the node and warning text in the node info, but allows cooking to continue. An "error" prevents cooking subsequent nodes, and displays a prominent badge on the node and error text in the node info. Error should only be used for problems that the network can't recover from.
    
Report This Error:
    If this expression evaluates to a non-zero value, the node reports this message/warning/error.
