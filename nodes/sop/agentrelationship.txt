"""Creates parent-child relationships between agents."""

This node creates parent-child relationships between agents, where one agent will follow the transform of another agent.
This is useful for scenarios such as attaching riders to horse or car agents.
Agents can have multiple children attached to them, and the hierarchy can be arbitrarily deep.

By default, the agents in the second input will be attached sequentially to the agents in the __Parent Group__, looping around if necessary.
For custom setups, the `agentrel_parentid` point attribute can be used to specify which parent agent to attach to.

=== Attributes ===

This node creates the following point attributes.
If any of these attributes are present on the input agents, they will override the corresponding parameters.

            Identifies the parent agent. This will use the `id` point attribute if present, and otherwise will use point numbers.
            A value less than 0 indicates that the agent does not have a parent.

            Indicates whether to match the parent joint's position, rotation, or both.
            The specifications for the values can be found in `$HFS/houdini/vex/include/crowd_relationships.h`.

@parameters

Parent Group:
    Specifies which parent agents the child agents will be attached to.

Constrain to Parent Joint:
    In addition to inheriting the parent agent's transform, the child agent (or one of its joints) can be attached to a particular joint of the parent agent.

Parent Joint:
    Specifies the joint to attach the child agent to.

Child Joint:
    Optionally specifies a joint of the child agent (such as the hips) that should be aligned with the __Parent Joint__.

Constraint Type:
    Specifies whether to only constrain the child agent to the position of the __Parent Joint__, its rotation, or both.

Translate:
    Additional translation to adjust the child's transform.

Rotate:
    Additional rotation to adjust the child's transform.

Transform Child Agents:
    Transforms the child agents to attach them to their parents.
