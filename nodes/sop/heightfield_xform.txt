"""Height field specific scales and offsets."""

TIP:
    You can use the regular [Transform node|Node:sop/xform] to move, scale, or rotate height fields. The [Height Field Layer|Node:sop/heightfield_layer] node does the right thing if you try to composite two height fields with different rotations or offset grids together.

The controls in the Scaling section work on the volume grid spacing and/or the `height` values to do height-specific scaling.


@parameters

~~~ Scaling ~~~

Uniform Scale:
    #id: scale
    
    Scales the grid spacing and the values in the `height` field equally so the terrain scales uniformly.
    
Grid Scale:
    #id: gridscale
    
    Scales the grid spacing, stretching or contracting the terrain horizontally.
    
    
Height Scale:
    #id: heightscale
    
    Scales the height values in the `height` field, stretching or contracting the terrain vertically.
    
    
Height Offset:
    #id: heightoffset
    
    Adds an offset to values in the `height` field, moving the terrain up or down.


~~~ Positioning ~~~

The controls are useful for volumes in the default ZX orientation. These are the same as using the regular [Transform node|Node:sop/xform].

Translate X:
    #id: tx
    
    Moves the volumes along the X axis.
    
Translate Z:
    #id: tz
    
    Moves the volumes along the Z axis.
    
    
Rotate Y:
    #id: ry
    
    Rotates the volumes around the Y axis.
