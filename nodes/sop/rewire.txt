"""Rewires vertices to different points specified by an attribute."""

== Overview ==

This node rewires vertices from their current points to the points specified by the __Target Points Attribute__.
The [Fuse node|Node:sop/fuse] can do rewiring based on the proximity of points alone, but Rewire allows for more custom rewiring.
__Target Points Attribute__ can be constructed in a variety of ways, but the [Attribute Wrangle node|Node:sop/attribwrangle] may be the most versatile.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    The subset of geometry whose vertices should be rewired.

    This can be a point, vertex, primitive, or edge group.  If necessary, it will be expanded to a point, vertex, or primitive group, depending on the class of __Target Points Attribute__.

Group Type:
    #id: grouptype

    The type of group that __Group__ specifies.

    If __Guess from Group__ is specified and the group type is ambiguous, the guess is made that __Group__ specifies a point group.

Target Points Attribute:
    #id: attrib

    This attribute specifies the points to which vertices should be rewired.  If it is a point or primitive attribute, all vertices from a point/primitive will be rewired to the point given by the attribute.  Invalid point numbers, such as -1, will result in no rewiring occurring.

Recursively Rewire Points:
    #id: recurse

    If the __Target Points Attribute__ is a point attribute and this is enabled, points will be rewired such that sequences of rewirings will be followed to their completion, e.g. rewiring point 5 to point 3 and point 3 to point 6 will wire point 5 to point 6.  If there are cycles, no points in the cycles will have their vertices rewired.

Keep Unused Points:
    #id: keepunusedpoints

    By default, points that have vertices rewired away from them and end with no vertices will be deleted.  Turn this on to keep those unused points.

Create Orig Points Attribute:
    #id: createorigattrib

    When enabled, a vertex attribute containing the original point number of every vertex, including those that didn't change, will be created with the specified name.

Orig Points Attribute:
    #id: origattrib

    When enabled, a vertex attribute containing the original point number of every vertex, including those that didn't change, will be created with the specified name.
