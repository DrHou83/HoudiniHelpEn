"""Instances individual waveforms onto input points and generated points."""

This node creates an ocean layer comprised of waveforms instanced onto input points and / or points generated within this SOP to create a wave train.  The output of this node can be merged with other ocean layers created by this node or the [Ocean Spectrum SOP|Node:sop/oceanspectrum].

If points are plugged into the first input of this node, waveforms will be instanced onto each input point with position and orientation controlled by its [Copying and Instancing|/copy/instanceattrs] attributes and the randomized parameters on the __Shape__ tab of this node.   This node can also generate its own instance points using the __Waves__ section.  The second input can be a volume mask similar to the one input to the [Ocean Spectrum SOP|Node:sop/oceanspectrum].

@parameters

== Waves ==

This section controls internally generated wave points.

Number of Waves:
    The number of wavefronts to create.

Points Per Wave:
    The number of points in each wave.  Each point will have a small waveform of the specified __Radius__ instanced onto it to create a waveform.

Size:
    The overall size across of the wave.

Separation:
    The distance between each wavefront if __Number of Waves__ is greater than 1.

Direction:
    The general direction the wavefronts will be facing.  This can be overridden on a per-point basis with the __Rotation__ point parameter.

Jitter Seed:
    The random seed used in jittering the wave points.

Jitter Scale:
    The amount to jitter the generated wave points in the ZX plane.

Animation Type:
    The method used for animating the waves.  __Wave Speed__ will move the wave in the __Direction__ they are pointing by the specified __Speed__.  __Center__ will move the center of the wavetrain.

Speed:
    The speed at which the waves should move.

Offset:
    The amount to offset the wave train along the __Direction__ vector.

Center:
    The center of the wave train.    

== Shape ==

Crest Width:
    The width of each individual waveform.

Chop:
    The amount of sharp cusps the waves will have.  Increasing this value too high can cause the waves to become too peaked and invert on themselves.

Radius:
    The radius of the instanced wave area.  This parameter overwrites any incoming `pscale` attribute on the input points.

Variance:
    #id: pointradvar
    The amount of randomness in the instanced ocean radius.

Rotation:
    The amount to rotate the instanced waves.  This parameter overwrites any incoming `rot` attribute on the input points.

Variance:
    #id: pointrotvar
    The amount of randomness in the instanced ocean orientation.

Amplitude:
    An amplitude scaling for the instanced waves.  This parameter overwrites any incoming `amplitude` attribute on the input points.

Variance:
    #id: pointampvar
    The amount of randomness in the instanced ocean orientation.

Shape Seed:
    A random seed for the __Shape__ parameters.


Compute Velocity:
    The method used for computing point velocities.  The wave instancing points should have proper point velocities to ensure correctly calculated ocean velocities.
