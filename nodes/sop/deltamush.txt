= DeltaMush =

"""Smooths out (or "relaxes") point deformations."""

This node is used smooth out the effect of point deformations by a copy of the
geometry before it was deformed.

To smooth out bone deform geometry, append this node to the output of a
[Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/deform] and use the input of the [Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/deform] as the second
input. 

For example,

In general, the deformation can be from any source (eg. from simulation).


NOTE:
    This node assumes non-manifold polygonal geometry (ie. there are no edges
    that have more than two adjacent polygons).

@parameters

Group:
    Subset of points to smooth.

Method:
    The weighting method used for smoothing.

    Uniform:
	Fastest method but assumes that the edge lengths are roughly the same
	everywhere.

    Edge Length:
	Uses the edge length to weight the smoothing so that more details are
	maintained. It can also prevent points from seemingly drift along the
	surface.

Iterations:
    The number of smoothing iterations to apply. More iterations result in
    smoother results. Generally, more iterations are needed for the same amount
    of smoothing for geometry that has higher point counts at the same size.

Step Size:
    The amount of smoothing applied for each iteration. Larger step sizes
    result in smoother results. If there are artifacts in the results, try
    using smaller step sizes along with more iterations (at the expense of
    longer cook times).

Pin Border Points:
    By default, delta mush will smooth everything. Turning this on will prevent the smoothing of border points that lie along unshared edges. For curves, only the end points are considered as border points.

Recompute Affected Normals:
    Recomputes any point (or vertex) normals that are affected by the smoothing
    operation. This option has no effect if the input geometry does not have a normal attribute.

Clamp Step Size:
    When enabled, the step size value will be limited to be between 0 and 1
    since the algorithm works best in this range.
