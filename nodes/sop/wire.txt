= Wireframe =

"""Constructs polygonal tubes around polylines, creating renderable geometry."""

The Wireframe operation converts edges to tubes and points to spheres, creating the look of a wire frame structure in rendering.

Wireframe works only with polygons and/or particles as input.

== Tips ==

- Use the [Poly Wire SOP|Node:sop/polywire] to create more complex tube geometry from curves, with smoother bends and intersections than Wireframe, especially for [L-systems|Node:sop/lsystem].

- Use the [Convert Line SOP|Node:sop/convertline] to create a line segment for each edge in incoming polygons.

- Use the [Ends SOP|Node:sop/ends] set to Unwrap U to open each of the closed polygons into an open curve that includes the start and end points.
