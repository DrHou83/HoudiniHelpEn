"""Smooths out (or "relaxes") polygons, meshes and curves without increasing the number of points."""

This node rearranges the existing points in the geometry to reduce roughness.

* To smooth by increasing the number of points, use the [Subdivide node|Node:sop/subdivide].

* To smooth by brushing over the object, use the [Sculpt tool|Node:sop/sculpt] and set one of the mouse buttons to "Smooth".

Smooth can also smooth any floating-point attributes, including color and texture coordinates.


== Using Smooth ==

# Select the points, facets, or object you want to smooth.
            
# Click the [Icon:SOP/smooth][Smooth|/nodes/sop/smooth] tool on the __Polygon__ tab.
            
You can change the smoothing specifications in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

NOTE:
    If you only want to smooth certain areas of your object, use the [Icon:SOP/sculpt][sculpt|sculpt] tool.


@parameters

Group:
    Subset of primitives to smooth.

Constrained Boundary:
    Lets you specify that the boundaries of the selection (the __Group__ field) or the surface should not move.

    None:
        No points are locked in place. Any point in the selection may move.
        
    Unshared Edges:
        Boundary edges are locked in place. Smoothing will not affect them.
        
    Group Boundary:
        Boundary edges *and* the outside edges of the selection are locked in place. Smoothing will not affect them.

Constrained Points:
    A list of points to lock in place, so smoothing will not affect them. You can click the [Icon:BUTTONS/reselect] Select button to the right of the field and select the vertices interactively in the viewport.

Attributes:
    The attributes to smooth. Multiple attributes can be smoothed at the same time. The drop-down menu to the right of the field has the most common attributes to smooth, `P` (point position) and `uv` (texture coordinates). If the field is blank, the node smooths _all_ position-type attributes.

Method:
    Lets you choose different smoothing models that have different effects on the point positions. 

    Uniform:
        Move points so they're evenly spaced.
        
    Scale-Dominant:
        Move points trying to maintain their original relative distances from one another.
        
    Curvature-Dominant:
        Move points to smooth the curvature while trying to maintain their original arrangement.

Strength:
    How much to smooth the selected points. Higher values move the points farther from their original positions.

Filter Quality:
    Higher values preserve finer details from the original mesh. Lower values are faster and smooth more.
    
    A lower number of passes is more efficient for producing significant smoothing on larger meshes.
