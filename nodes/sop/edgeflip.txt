"""Flips the direction of polygon edges."""

You can set the number of times to flip the edge (Number of Cycles).
You can also choose to cycle vertex attributes or not.
This is useful when vertices have texture coordinates.

== Using EdgeFlip ==
            
# Select the edges you want to flip.
                
# Click the [Icon:SOP/edgeflip][Edgeflip|/nodes/sop/edgeflip] tool on the __Polygon__ tab.

@parameters

Group:
    The edges to flip.

Cycles:
    #id: cycles

    The number of times to flip the edges.

Cycle Vertex Attributes:
    #id: cycleattribs

    Toggles whether or not the vertex attributes cycle with the
    edges or remain fixed.
