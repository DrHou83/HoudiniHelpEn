"""Packs geometry into an embedded primitive."""

== Packing Geometry Into A Single Primitive ==

This SOP takes the input geometry and packages it up into an embedded packed primitive.

An embedded packed primitive stores a copy of the input geometry as part of the primitive's data.  Any copies of the embedded primitive will share the embedded geometry, potentially with significant memory savings.

This provides a way of instancing geometry without saving to disk.

@parameters

Display As:
    How packed primitives should be displayed in the viewport.
    
Path Attribute:
    The path attribute value assigned to the newly created packed primitive.  If this field is disabled or left blank, no path attribute will be created.
    
Pack By Name:
    The SOP's geometry is divided into one or more packed fragments. For
    every unique value of the name attribute, a packed primitive will be
    created with only the primitives or points that have that attribute value.
    
Name Attribute:
    Specifies the primitive or point, string or integer attribute used to
    identify primitives belonging to each fragment.  If a point attribute
    is specified, only the points will be packed.

    
Create Packed Fragments:
    Specifies Packed Fragment primitives should be created instead of Packed
    Geometry primitives.  This only works with primitive string attributes.

    TIP:
	Packed Fragment primitives are more efficient if the final rendered
	geometry has many unique pieces.  Packed Geometry primitives are more
	efficient if the final rendered geometry has many copies of the same
	piece.


Pivot Location:
    Specifies how to initialize the offset for the point referenced by the
    packed primitive.

Transfer Attributes:
    #id: transfer_attributes
    Specifies a list of attributes to transfer to the packed geometry.

Transfer Groups:
    #id: transfer_groups
    Specifies a list of groups to transfer to the packed geometry.
