"""Tests VDBs for Bad Values and Repairs."""

The VDB Diagonistics node has a suite of tests to validate and correct common errors in VDB nodes.  For most errors, it provides an option of marking the troublesome voxels and/or repairing them.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    Which input VDBs to examine.
    
    
Mark in Mask Grid:
    #id: usemask
    
    For tests set to Mark, output a mask VDB that highlights problematic regions in input VDBs.
    
Mark as Points With Values:
    #id: usepoints

    For tests set to Mark, output a point cloud that highlights problematic regions in input VDBs.
    
    
Respect Grid Class:
    #id: respectclass
    
    If disabled, apply fog volume and level set tests to all VDBs, not just VDBs classified as fog volumes or level sets.
    
Validate Fog Volumes:
    #id: verify_fogvolume
    
    Verify that VDBs classified as fog volumes are valid fog volumes.
    
Validate for SDF CSG and Fracture:
    #id: verify_csg

    Verify that SDF VDBs meet the requirements for CSG and fracture operations.
    
Validate for SDF Filtering and Renormalization:
    #id: verify_filtering
    
    Verify that SDF VDBs meet the requirements for filtering and renormalization.
    
Validate for SDF Advection and Morphing:
    #id: verify_advection
    
    Verify that SDF VDBs meet the requirements for advection and morphing.
    
Finite Values:
    #id: test_finite
    
    Verify that all values are finite and non-NaN.
    
Uniform Background:
    #id: test_background
    
    Verify that all inactive voxels are set to the background value.
    
Values in Range:
    #id: test_valrange
    
    Verify that all scalar voxel values and vector magnitudes are in the given range.
    
Range:
    #id: valrange
    
    Minimum and maximum allowed values (inclusive)
    
Symmetric Narrow Band:
    #id: test_symmetric

    Verify that SDF inside and outside values are of equal magnitude.
    
Minimum Band Width:
    #id: test_bandwidth
    
    Verify that interior and exterior narrow band widths are sufficiently large.
    
Closed Surface:
    #id: test_surface
    
    Verify that SDFs represent watertight surfaces.
    
Gradient Magnitude:
    #id: test_gradient
    
    Verify that the SDF gradient has magnitude one everywhere (within a given tolerance).
    
Inactive Tiles:
    #id: test_activetiles

    Verify that SDFs have no active tiles. These would represent constant regions that should not occur in an SDF.
    
    
Uniform Voxel Size:
    #id: test_voxelsize
    
    Verify that SDFs have uniform voxel sizes.
    
Background Zero:
    #id: test_backgroundzero
    
    Verify that all inactive voxels in fog volumes have value zero.
    
Active Values in [0, 1]:
    #id: test_fogvalues

    Verify that all active voxels in fog volumes have values in the range [0, 1].
