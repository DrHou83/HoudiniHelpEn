= Hair Generate =

"""Generates hair on a surface or from points."""

Optionally uses curves as guides for shaping the generated hair.

NOTE:
    This node can generate stable output from just animated skin and guides, as long as both have a rest attribute. This can be used as an alternative to plugging in rest skin and guides to the first and second inputs and animated skin and guides into the third and forth inputs.

@parameters

== General ==

=== Distribution ===

Mode:
    #id: mode

    Scatter On Surface:
	Scatter guides on the surface skin surface.

    Per Point:
	Generate a guide at each point of the skin geometry.


Group:
    #id: group
    Generate curves for this group of skin primitives.


Density:
    #id: density
    Scatter hair or guides at this density.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Scatter Seed:
    #id: scatterseed

    The seed value used for scattering. Changing this generates a different
    random distribution with the same density.

Relax Iterations:
    #id: scatterrelaxiterations

    The number of times to relax guide locations after scattering. Higher
    iterations result in a more even distribution of guides at the cost of more
    computation time.

Relax Using Normal Attribute:
    #id: relaxusenormals

    Takes the surface normal attribute into account when scattering.

=== Optimization ===

Prune:
    #id: prune
    Prune a percentage of hair to speed up cooking.

Pruning Ratio:
    #id: pruningratio

    The percentage of curves to prune.

Limit To Bounding Box:
    #id: limittobbox

    Only grow hair from root points that are within the bounding boxes defined
    by the parameters below.

Box Size:
    #id: bboxsize

    The size of the bounding box.

Center:
    #id: bboxcenter

    The center of the bounding box.


=== Guide Weights ===

This node generates hair using by blending the shape of nearby curves.
These parameters control how much each guide influences the shape of generated
hair.

Use Guides:
    #id: useguides

    Blend between the shape of nearby guide curves to determine the shape of
    the each generated hair.

Assume Uniform Segment Count & Length:
    #id: uniformguidesegments

    Use a faster guide interpolation algorithm, which requires that all guides
    have the same segment count.

Compute Weights Using Skin Coordinates:
    #id: skininterp

    Compute guide weights using the hair's position within its skin primitive.
    This is robust and accurate, but can look less natural than weight
    computation based on guide distance, which is used when this is disabled.

    This can only be used when guides are located at each skin point.

    TIP:
	    Use the [Guide Groom Object|Node:obj/guidegroom]'s __Guide Per Point__ mode to create guides that work with this method.

Blending Method:
    #id: guideblendmethod

    Controls how guides that influence a generated curve are blended.

    Linear Blend:
	Does a straight-forward linear blend between the guide curves.

    Extrude And Blend:
	Extrudes the curve along each guide and then blends those extruded curves.

Guide Group:
    #id: guidegroup

    The group of guides to use.

Influence Radius:
    #id: influenceradius

    The radius within which guides have influence over generated hair.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Influence Decay:
    #id: influencedecay

    Controls how steeply the weight of a guide drops with distance. Higher
    values cause guides to have less influence over distant hairs, resulting
    in hair more closely following guides near them. Lower values tend to
    result in a smoother look as the effect of all guides is averaged.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Maximum Guide Count:
    #id: maxguidecount

    The maximum number of guides to take into account. Any excess guides found
    within the __Influence Radius__ are ignored.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Max Guide Angle:
    #id: maxguideangle

    Ignore guides that face away from the skin normal at the hair root by more
    than this angle in degrees.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Clump Crossover:
    #id: clumpcrossover

    Blends the shapes of clumps of guide hair. At a value of `0`, only the
    clump that exhibits the greatest influence of the generated hair is taken
    into account. Higher values cause surrounding clumps to be taken into account
    as well.

    TIP: Guide hair clumps can be created using the
    [Hair Clump SOP|Node:sop/hairclump].

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Create Guide & Weight Attribs:
    #id: createweightattribs

    Outputs the guide indices and weights used for interpolation as array
    attributes on the generated primitives.

=== Unguided Hairs ===

Grow Unguided Hair:
    #id: growunguided

    Grows hair at points that are outside of the influence radius of any guides.

Use Initial Direction Attribute:
    #id: useinitdirattrib

    Grow hair in the direction of a vector attribute on the skin geometry.

Initial Dir Attrib:
    #id: initdirattrib

    The name of a vector attribute on the skin geometry used as the initial
    direction of unguided hair.

Segments:
    #id: unguidedsegments

    Generate hairs with this segment count.

    NOTE:
	When there are any guides, this node generates hairs
	with the same segment count as those guides and this parameter is
	ignored.

Length:
    #id: unguidedlength

    Generate unguided hair of this length.

    [Include:fur_common#parmoverride]

Minimum Length:
    #id: unguidedminlength

    The minimum length required to grow a hair. Any hair that would be shorter
    than this value is not grown at all.

== Attributes & Appearance ==

=== Thickness ===

Create Thickness Attribute:
    #id: outputthicknessattrib

    Add a thickness attribute to generated hair.

Thickness Attribute:
    #id: thicknessattrib

    The name of the created thickness attribute.

Thickness:
    #id: thickness

    The thickness of generated hair at it's thickest point.

Hair Profile:
    #id: hairprofile

    The profile of thickness along the length of each hair.

=== Source Attribute Transfer ===

to generated hair.

    #id: pointattribs

    A list of attributes to transfer from the skin geometry's points to the
    hair primitives.
