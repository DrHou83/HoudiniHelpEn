= Guide Partition =

"""Creates and prepares parting lines for use with hair generation."""

Provides the interface for creating parting lines and adding them to a groom. This node creates the required curve attributes for hair interpolation to use the parting lines.

@parameters

Draw Parting Line:
    #id: drawpartingline

    Create a [Draw Curve SOP|Node:sop/drawcurve] and start drawing.

== Parting Properties ==

Radius:
    #id: partingradius
    The radius within which the curves can influence hair interpolation.

Strength:
    #id: partingstrength
    The curve influence strength. A value of `1.0` means that guides on one
    side of the parting line may not affect hair on the other side at all.

== Resample ==

Resample:
    #id: resample
    Resample parting lines. This is usually required with drawn curves, as they
    have far more segments than required, which can degrade performance.

Segment Length:
    #id: resampleseglength
    Segment length of resampling.
