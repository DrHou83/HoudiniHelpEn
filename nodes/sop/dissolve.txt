"""Deletes edges from the input polygonal geometry merging polygons with
shared edges."""

TIP:
    This operator can easily create polygons with more than 4 sides.
    You may want to append a [Divide SOP|Node:sop/divide] to triangulate
    any N-sided polygons created by this operator.

== Using Dissolve ==

# Select the points, edges, or polygons you wish to dissolve.
        
# Click the [Icon:SOP/dissolve][Dissolve|/nodes/sop/dissolve] tool on the __Polygon__ tab.
        
Turning on the __Remove Inline Points__ checkbox on the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] will remove points that no longer have edges attached.

@parameters

Group:
    The edges to delete. Edges that are not part of any entity in the
    group field do not get deleted.  If primitives or points are specified,
    all edges referencing those entities will be deleted.

    Normally you will use this operator in the scene view and simply
    select the edges you want; however, if you need to you can also
    use a space-separated list of the following codes in this field
    to specify edges:

    [Include:edgespec]

Operation:
    Delete selected:
        Delete the entities listed in the __Group__ field.
    Delete non-selected:
        Delete all entities _except_ those listed in the __Group__
        field.

Recompute Normals:
    Calculates the normals on remaining geometry after the deletion
    occurs.

Remove Inline Points:
    Removes points of dissolved edges if they do not affect the
    resulting shape.

Collinearity Tolerance:
    Points within this angle of being a straight line are deleted when
    __Remove Inline Points__ is on.

Remove Unused Points:
    Deletes points that are no longer referenced by primitives after
    dissolving edges.

Bridge:
    Create Bridged Polygons:
	Bridge edges will be re-introduced if bridge edges that connect
	surface boundaries are dissolved.
    Create Disjoint Polygons:
	Disjoint surfaces will result if bridge edges that connect surface
	boundaries are dissolved.
    Delete Polygons:
	Polygons will be deleted if bridge edges that connect surface
	boundaries are dissolved.

Remove Degenerate Bridges:
    Deletes degenerate bridge edges from primitives after dissolving edges.

Create Curves When Dissolving Boundary:
    When enabled, dissolving an unshared edge will result in curves
    containing the remaining boundary edges.
