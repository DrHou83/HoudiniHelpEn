= Volume Velocity from Curves =

"""Generates a volume velocity field using curve tangents."""

@parameters

== Velocity Volume ==

Voxel Size:
    #id: voxelsize

    The voxel size to use.

Smooth Velocities:
    #id: smooth

    Smooth velocities after interpolating them from curves tangents.

Voxel Radius:
    #id: smoothradius

    The smoothing radius in voxels.

Blur Iterations:
    #id: bluriterations

    The number of times to perform smoothing.

== Reference Volume ==

Reference Volume:
    #id: refvol

    Create the velocity volumes using this volume as a reference.

Activate Voxels by Reference Volume:
    #id: createfromrefvol

    Create velocity volume voxels in regions where the reference volume is active.

Match Reference Volume:
    #id: matchrefvol

    Match the transform and voxel size of the reference volume.

== Surface Geometry ==

Determine Voxel Size from Average Primitive Area:
    #id: voxelsizefromsurface

    Set the voxel size to the square root of the average primitive area.

    This is usually a good size for effects that require accurate volume data close to the surface.

Voxel Scale:
    #id: surfacevoxelscale

    The determined voxel size is scaled by this factor.

Activate Voxels by Surface:
    #id: createfromsurface

    Create velocity volume voxels in a band around the second input's surface geometry.

Exterior Band:
    #id: surfaceextband

    The width of the volume band on the exterior of the surface.

Interior Band:
    #id: surfaceintband

    The width of the volume band on the interior of the surface.

Fill Interior:
    #id: surfacefillinterior

    Fill the interior of the surface with voxels.

Follow Surface:
    #id: surfacetangent

    Force the created velocities to be tangential to the surface. This only works within the surface band, specified by __Interior Band__ and __Exterior Band__, not in regions activated by other means.

Surface Lift:
    #id: surfacelift

    Direct velocities away from the surface. Setting this to `1.0` makes velocities point straight out of the surface.

    NOTE:
	It is possible to use negative values to direct velocities into the surface.


== Lookup Radius ==

Radius Mode:
    #id: radiusmode

    Constant:

	Look up curve tangents within a constant radius.

    Find Minimum Number of Curves:

	Automatically compute an appropriate radius that will include at least the specified number of curves.

    Radius Volume:

	Sample radius values from a volume in the 3rd input.

Radius:
    #id: radius

    The constant curve lookup radius.

Minimum Curves in Radius:
    #id: curvecoverage

    The minimum number of curves to include.

Radius Volume:
    #id: radiusvol

    The volume to sample radius values from.

Radius Multiplier:
    #id: radiusmult

    A multiplier against the computed or sampled radius.
