"""Supports Muscle Deform by assigning capture weights to points based on distance away from given primitives"""

This node creates capture weights on points within a certain radius away from
the given set of muscle primitives. The weights are unique to the given primitive
Muscle ID attribute. This means that a point falling within a __Radius__
distance away from a muscle primitive with a certain ID will get a weight based
on how far it is assigned to that ID. Thus each point may have multiple weights
corresponding to multiple unique muscle IDs.


== Using Muscle Deform ==

Simply feed the skin geometry to the first input and muscle geometry to the
second input providing the relevant __Muscle ID__ and the points overlapping
with the given muscle primitives will be marked. To see which points are
weighted consider using the [Capture Layer Paint|Node:sop/capturelayerpaint] SOP.

If the muscles have limited geometry in the interior, weights may be missing
from where the interior of muscles intersected the skin points. To resolve this
issue, you may provide points or Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) in the form of
VDBs (for this to work you must enabled the __SDF Muscles__ option) instead.
VDBs are preferred for volumetric representations.



@parameters

Group:
    Subset of points to assign weights to.

SDF Muscles:
    Expect VDB signed distance fields on the second input.

Muscle ID:
    Unique ID attribute assigned to distinguish between different muscle groups.

Radius:
    Points within this distance will be assigned a non-zero weight for the corresponding muscle ID.

Falloff Weight:
    Optional weight attribute that specifies the general area of skin being affected by muscles. This considers all muscles regardless of Muscle ID.

Falloff Radius:
    Points within this distance will be assigned a non-zero weight.
