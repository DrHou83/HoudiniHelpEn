"""This material applies a texture an object."""

NOTE:
    You should add texture coordinates to polygonal objects before using the Decal material. See [the help on textures|/shade/textures].

@parameters

== Surface ==

Ambient Intensity:
	A multiplier for the [ambient|/nodes/vop/ambient] contribution to the material.
	The ambient lighting model only looks at the ambient lights in the scene.
	If there are no ambient light, this slider will have no affect.

Lambert Intensity:
	A multiplier for the [diffuse|/nodes/vop/lambert] contribution to the material.

Use Base Color:
	If this box is not checked, the _Base Color_ is ignored.  Defaults to on.
	If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_
	are all off, the surface color will be white.

Base Color:
	This is the main surface color for the material. Defaults to white.

Use Point Color:
	If this box is checked and the point color, (`Cd`), is defined, 
	then `Cd` is multiplied with the _Base Color_.  Defaults to on.
	If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_
	are all off, the surface color will be white.

Opacity:
	The opacity color for this material.

Use Point Alpha:
	If set, the Alpha attributes will be multiplied into the
	final Opacity.  If no Alpha Attribute exists, Opacity is unaffected.
	
=== Decal ===

Decal Texture:
    The texture file to decal on the surface.

Decal X/Y Offset:
    Positions the texture on the surface.

Decal X/Y Scale:
    Increases or decreases the size of the texture on the surface.

Decal Rotation: 
    Rotates the texture on the surface.

=== Color Map ===

Use Color Map:
	If this box is checked the _Base Color_ is multiplied by the specified texture map.
	Defaults to off. If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_
	are all off, the surface color will be white.

Base Color Map:
	This the name of the texture file. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Color Map Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.

Color Map Filter: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Width: 
	Filter Width is the number of pixels, in both u and v directions, to use in filtering.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Border: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

=== Specular ===

Specular Intensity:
	    A multiplier for the [specular|/nodes/vop/specular] contribution to the material.

Specular Color:
	    The [specular|/nodes/vop/specular] highlight color, defaults to a very pale pink.

U Roughness:
	    This value controls the size or spread of the [specular|/nodes/vop/specular] highlight. 
	    If Anisotropic is selected, this value controls the specular highlight in only the __U__ direction.

V Roughness:
	    If Anisotropic is selected, this value controls the [specular|/nodes/vop/specular] highlight in only the __V__ direction It is ignored with any other specular function.

Sharpness:
	    This value controls the sharpness of the edge of the [specular|/nodes/vop/specular] highlight.  It is used only if Glossy specular is selected.

Specular Type:
	    A selector for the [specular|/nodes/vop/specular] function. Anisotropic is used to get an elliptical highlight. Glossy is typically used for highly reflective materials to get a sharp edges highlight. Defaults to the VEX specular function.

==== Specular Mask ====

Use Specular Mask:
	If this box is checked, the specular color is multiplied by
	the color of the texture in _Specular Mask_.  Defaults to off.

Specular Mask:
	This the name of the texture file. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Specular Mask Channel:
     Picks which channel of the texture is used for the mask. This allows using the one map for 3 masks. The default is lum which uses the luminance of all the channels in the texture as the mask.

Spec Mask Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.

Spec Mask Filter: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Spec Mask Filter Width: 
	Filter Width is the number of pixels, in both u and v directions, to use in filtering.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Spec Mask Border: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.
