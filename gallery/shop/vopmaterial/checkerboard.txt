"""This is a basic material with checked color map."""

This is a basic material with a checked color map used as the surface color.
This material has a choice of specular functions and a map for the specular contribution.

@parameters

== Surface ==

Ambient Intensity:
	A multiplier for the ambient contribution to the material. The ambient lighting model only looks at the ambient lights in the scene. If there are no ambient light, this slider will have no affect.

Lambert Intensity:
	A multiplier for the [diffuse|/nodes/vop/lambert] contribution to the material.

Use Base Color:
	If this box is not checked, the _Base Color_ is ignored. Defaults to on. If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_ are all off, the surface color will be white.

Base Color:
	This is the main surface color for the material. Defaults to white.

Use Point Color:
	If this box is checked and the point color, (`Cd`), is defined, then `Cd` is multiplied with the _Base Color_.  Defaults to on. If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_ are all off, the surface color will be white.

Opacity:
	The opacity color for this material.

Use Point Alpha:
	If set, the Alpha attributes will be multiplied into the
	final Opacity.  If no Alpha Attribute exists, Opacity is unaffected.

== Color Map ==

Use Color Map:
	If this box is checked the _Base Color_ is multiplied by the specified texture map.  Defaults to off. If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_ are all off, the surface color will be white.

Check Frequency:
    This is the number of times to tile (repeat) the map specified below.

Base Color Map:
	This the name of the texture file. It defaults to _*gBWCheck.rat*_. This is a 2 by 2 black and white checked map. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Color Map Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates are larger or less than 0 to 1. The options are:
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Filter: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Width: 
	Filter Width is the number of pixels, in both u and v directions, to use in filtering.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Border: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

== Specular ==

Specular Intensity:
	A multiplier for the specular contribution to the material.

Specular Color:
	The specular highlight color, defaults to white.

U Roughness:
	This value controls the size or spread of the specular highlight. When Anisotropic is selected, this value controls the specular highlight only in the __U__ direction.

V Roughness:
	When Anisotropic is selected, this value controls the specular highlight only in the __V__ direction. It is ignored with any other specular function.

Sharpness:
	This value controls the sharpness of the edge of the specular highlight. It is used only if Glossy specular is selected.

Specular Type:
	A selector for the specular function.  Anisotropic is used to get an elliptical highlight.  Glossy is typically used for highly reflective materials to get a sharp edges highlight.
	See [specular|/nodes/vop/specular] for more information.

=== Specular Map ===

Use Specular Map:
	If this box is checked, the specular color is multiplied by
	the color of the texture in _Specular Map_.  Defaults to off.

Specular Map:
	This the name of the texture file. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Spec Map Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. The options are:
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Spec Map Filter: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Spec Map Width: 
	Filter Width is the number of pixels, in both u and v directions, to use in filtering.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Spec Map Border: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.
