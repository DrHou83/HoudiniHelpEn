= Basic Smoke =

"""A diffuse material designed specifically for volume objects."""

@parameters

Smoke Color:
    This is the color of the smoke.  

Use Point Color:
    If this toggle is on, the smoke color is multiplied by any point color.

Smoke Density:
    The overall density of the smoke.
    Higher values are more opaque smoke that reflects light faster.

Shadow Density: 
    This is the same as Smoke Density but is used in the shadow pass.  
    This controls how much light the smoke will block.

Receive Shadows: 
    If this toggle is on, the smoke tests for light visibility.  
    Enabling shadows also enables self-shadowing.  

    NOTE:
	For performance reasons, it is recommended to use Shadow Maps for shadowed smoke.

Illuminance Angle: 
    This is the angle of the cone, in which the smoke will test for shadows.
