"""Basic material with a choice or blend of displacements."""

This is an basic material with a choice or blend of three types of displacement:

* Procedural
* Texture mapped
* Both together

...and a mask to limit the effect.

@parameters

== Surface ==

=== Surface ===

Diffuse Reflectivity:
    TBD.

Diffuse Roughness:
    TBD.

Use Base Color:
	If this box is not checked, the _Base Color_ is ignored.  Defaults to on.
	If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_
	are all off, the surface color will be white.

Base Color:
	This is the main surface color for the material. Defaults to white.

Opacity:
	The opacity color for this material.

Use Point Alpha:
	If set, the Alpha attributes will be multiplied into the
	final Opacity.  If no Alpha Attribute exists, Opacity is unaffected.

==== Color map ====

Use Color Map:
	If this box is checked the _Base Color_ is multiplied by the specified texture map.
	Defaults to off. If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_
	are all off, the surface color will be white.

Base Color Map:
	This the name of the texture file. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Color Map Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. The options are:
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Filter: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Width: 
	This is the width in pixels used by the filter in both u and v directions.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Border: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.

==== Specular ====

Specular Model:
    TBD.

Specular Intensity:
	A multiplier for the specular contribution to the material.

Specular Color:
	The specular highlight color, defaults to white.

Specular Angle:
    TBD.

Specular Anisotropy:
    TBD.

=== Displacement ===

Overall scale:
    Controls the overall scale of the rough areas.

Displace Direction:
    TBD.

==== Map ====

Use Displace Map:
	If this box is checked the specified texture map used for the displacement.
	Defaults to on. If there is no map, there is no displacement.

Displacement Map:
	This the name of the texture file. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Disp Map Channel:
    TBD.

Disp Map Wrap:
	Determines what the map returns when the texture coordinates
	are larger than 1 or less than 0. The options are:
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Disp Map Filter: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Disp Map Width: 
	This is the width in pixels used by the filter in both u and v directions.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Disp Map Border: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.

==== Noise ====

Use Noise:
    TBD.

Noise Type:
    TBD.

Noise Frequency:
	The scale of the noise pattern. Larger values give smaller,
	but not more detailed, patterns. Smaller values will benefit
	from higher _Turbulence_ numbers.
	See [turbulent|/nodes/vop/turbnoise] for more information.

Noise Offset:
	This vector positions the noise on the object in x, y and z.
	See [turbulent|/nodes/vop/turbnoise] for more information.

Noise Amplitude:
	The bounds of [noise function|/nodes/vop/turbnoise], in the case 
	of original Perlin noise, -1 to 1, are multiplied by this value
	to determine the amount of displacement.
	Then this value is multiplied by the _Overall Scale_.
	See [turbulent|/nodes/vop/turbnoise] for more information.

Noise Roughness:
	This value sharpens or softens the edges of the noise.
	Lower values are softer, higher values sharper. 
	Sharper edges may cause aliasing issues in motion.
	See [turbulent|/nodes/vop/turbnoise] for more information.

Noise Attenuation:
	This value shifts the median value of the noise. Values greater than 1,
	will dampen the noise down, whereas values less than 1 will sharpen the
	contrast between the noise values.
	See [turbulent|/nodes/vop/turbnoise] for more information.

Noise Turbulence:
	This value controls the amount of details in the noise. 
	This is the number of times the noise function is called and summed.
	If the _Frequency_ is high, there is no need for much detail, 1 or 2 should be plenty.
	This can effects the _Amplitude_ of the noise as well since the summing
	will result in higher base values.
	See [turbulent|/nodes/vop/turbnoise] for more information.

==== Mask ====

Use Limit Mask:
	If this box is checked, the _Overall Scale_ is multiplied by
	the texture map in _Displacement Mask_.  Defaults to off.

Limit Mask:
	This the name of the mask file. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Limit Mask Channel:
	Picks which channel of the texture is used for the mask.
	This allows using the one map for 3 masks. The default is
	_lum_ which uses the luminance of all the channels in the texture as the mask.

Limit Mask Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. The options are:
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture value at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Limit Mask Filter: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Limit Mask Width: 
	This is the width in pixels used by the filter in both u and v directions.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Limit Mask Border: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.
	This should be selected based on the _Displacement Offset_.

=== Properties ===

Displacement Bounds:
	Usually tying this value to the displacement _Overall Scale_
	should work well. However making the [displacement bounds |/props/mantra] 
	as small as possible, without causing "rips" in the render, can lower
	render times. See [render properties|/props] for more information.
