= Clay =

"""This is basic diffuse material without specular."""

This is a basic matte material with no specular, though it is simple to add.
There are options for color map to be used as the surface color.
It a good material for any soft powdery, non-reflective surface,
such as clay, chalk, dirt, blackboards, matte paint, etc.

@parameters

== Surface ==

Ambient Intensity:
	A multiplier for the [ambient|/nodes/vop/ambient] contribution 
    to the material.  The ambient lighting model looks only at the 
    ambient lights in the scene.  If there are no ambient lights, 
    this slider will have no affect.

Diffuse Intensity:
	A multiplier for the diffuse contribution to the material.
	This material uses the [Oren-Nayer diffuse|/nodes/vop/oren] calculation. 
	This is a more sophisticated diffuse calculation than Lambert's. 

Diffuse Roughness:
	This is an exponent for [Oren-Nayer diffuse|/nodes/vop/oren]. 
	It controls the size or spread of the diffuse contribution.

Use Base Color:
	If this box is not checked, the _Base Color_ is ignored.  Defaults to on.
	If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_
	are all off, the surface color will be white.

Base Color:
	This is the main surface color for the material. Defaults to white.

Use Point Color:
	If this box is checked and the point color, (`Cd`), is defined, 
	then `Cd` is multiplied with the _Base Color_.  Defaults to on.
	If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_
	are all off, the surface color will be white.

Opacity:
	The opacity color for this material.

Use Point Alpha:
	If set, the Alpha attributes will be multiplied into the
	final Opacity.  If no Alpha Attribute exists, Opacity is unaffected.

== Color Map ==

Use Color Map:
	If this box is checked the _Base Color_ is multiplied by the specified texture map.
	Defaults to off. If _Use Base Color_, _Use Point Color_ and _Use Color Map_
	are all off, the surface color will be white.

Base Color Map:
	This the name of the texture file. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Color Map Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. The options are:
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Filter Type: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Filter Width: 
	Filter Width is the number of pixels, in both u and v directions, to use in filtering.

Color Map Border Color: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.
