= Show Shading Point =

"""This is a constant material showing the value of the shading point's x y z values in a red, green, blue color."""

This material is a constant shader and is not affected by lighting.
It is used to shows the value of the shading point's x y z values in a red, green, blue color.
The point is first normalized, to make sure all the values are between -1 and 1.
Then the values are shifted into the 0 to 1 range for colors. This way 0.5 is 0 and 0 is -1.

The __x__ value of the shading point, *P*, * is in the red channel.
The __y__ value of the shading point, *P*, * is in the green channel.
The __z__ value of the shading point, *P*, * is in the blue channel.
