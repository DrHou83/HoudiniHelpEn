"""This is basic diffuse material, no specular, with a map of colored and numbered squares."""

This is a plain diffuse material with no specular.  There is a default 
color map of colored and numbered squares useful in checking how texture coordinates lie.

@parameters

== Surface ==

Lambert Intensity:
	A multiplier for the diffuse contribution to the material.
	This material uses the [Oren-Nayer diffuse|/nodes/vop/oren] calculation. 
	This is a more sophisticated diffuse calculation than Lambert's. 

Opacity:
	The opacity color for this material.

Use Point Alpha:
	If set, the Alpha attributes will be multiplied into the
	final Opacity.  If no Alpha Attribute exists, Opacity is unaffected.

== Color Map ==

Base Color Map:
	This the name of the texture file. This defaults to _*UVcolor.rat*_.
    This map is useful for checking how texture coordinates lie or the lookup
    of a environment map.

Color Map Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. The options are:
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Filter Type: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Color Map Filter Width: 
	Filter Width is the number of pixels, in both u and v directions, to use in filtering.

Color Map Border Color: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.
