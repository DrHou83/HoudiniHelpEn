= Show Tangent =

"""This is a constant material showing the value of the surface tangent's x y z directions in a red, green, blue color."""

This material is a constant shader and is not affected by lighting.
It is used to show the value of the surface tangent's x y z directions in a red, green, blue color.

The chosen tangent is first normalized, to make sure all the values are between -1 and 1.
Then the absolute value is used to move the values into the 0 to 1 range for colors.

The __x__ direction of the chosen surface tangent is in the red channel.
The __y__ direction of the chosen surface tangent is in the green channel.
The __z__ direction of the chosen surface tangent is in the blue channel.

@parameters

Choose dPds or dPdt:
    This selects which surface tangent to use, __dPds__ or __dPdt__.
