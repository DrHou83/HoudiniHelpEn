@parameters

== Color ==

Contribute Diffuse Lighting:
    Turn this off to make the material diffuse component ignore lighting.

Lambert Intensity:
    When __Contribute Diffuse Lighting__ is on, the relationship between the surface's angle to the camera and the amount of Lambert reflection.

Base Color:
    The relationship between the surface's angle to the camera and its base color.

Opacity:
    The relationship between the surface's angle to the camera and its opacity, where white is opaque and black is transparent.

== Specular ==

Use Specular lighting:
    Turn this on to add specular reflections of lights.
