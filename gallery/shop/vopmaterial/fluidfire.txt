"""A constant material where the density value of the volume drives the color ramp."""

This material is a constant shader and is not affected by lighting.  The surface color is uses the _noramlfalloff_ VOP to determine the color.  _Normal Falloff_ is the cosine of the angle between the camera ray and the surface normal.  The opacity is also determined with normal falloff plus a texture map. No lighting is needed with this material. It is treated as an emitter, so there is no self-shadowing.

@parameters

== Flame Colors ==

Color Intensity:
	A multiplier to darken or brighten the surface color.

Color Shift:
	This is an exponent which effects how quickly the falloff goes to 0.  Higher numbers make the center stronger and the edges more transparent. Or visa versa if the _Flip_ toggle is on.

Tint with Point Color:
	If this box is checked and the point color, (`Cd`), is defined, then that color is multiplied with the result of the color ramp.


Flame Base Color:
	The first color in the ramp. When the driver of the [spline|/nodes/vop/spline] is 0, this is the color returned. Defaults to very dark blue.

Flame Color 2:
	The next color in the ramp. When the driver of the [spline|/nodes/vop/spline] is 0.2, this is the color returned. Defaults to deep purple.

Flame Color 3:
	The next color in the ramp. When the driver of the [spline|/nodes/vop/spline] is 0.4, this is the color returned. Defaults to red.

Flame Color 4:
	The next color in the ramp. When the driver of the [spline|/nodes/vop/spline] is 0.6, this is the color returned. Defaults to orange.

Flame Color 5:
	The next color in the ramp. When the driver of the [spline|/nodes/vop/spline] is 0.8, this is the color returned. Defaults to yellow.

Flame Color 6:
	The last color in the ramp. When the driver of the [spline|/nodes/vop/spline] is 1, this is the color returned. Defaults to white. More may be added as desired.

== Pattern ==

Noise Frequency:
	This value controls how "wiggly" the flames are. Smaller values will benefit from higher _Octaves_ values. Low _Frequency_ and low _Octaves_ give very smooth flames.

Noise Offset:
	This vector positions the noise in x, y, and z. This vector can be used to animate the flames. As an example, a positive `$T` times some speed value in y, gives the appearance the flames are "rising". Positive values in x and negative values in z (or vise versa) give a "swirling" appearance.

Noise Jitter:
	This vector specifies the amount of jitter in x, y, and z.  This affects the amount of variance in the displacement and therefore the color.

Noise Octaves:
	This value controls the amount of details in the noise.  This is the number of times the noise function is called and added to the previous value.  If the _Frequency_ is high, there is no need for so much detail, 1 or 2 should be plenty.  More octaves can affects the overall scale of the displacement as more summing will result in higher base values.

Octave Stepsize:
    This value determines the space between the _Octaves_. Lower values generate "looser" flames. Higher values give more frenzied flames.
