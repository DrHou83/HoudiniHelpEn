Based on the [Hair Model|Node:vop/hairmodel] VOP. Please follow the link for a detailed technical explanation of the lighting model used by this shader.

@parameters

== Surface ==

=== Diffuse ===

==== General ====
Tint with Point Color:
	Multiply color with the Cd attribute on hair primitives, if present.

Diffuse Intensity:
	A multiplier against the diffuse color.

==== Root Color ====
Root Color:
	Uniform color of hair at the root.

    NOTE:
        This is used for both roots and tips if __Use Separate Tip Color__ is turned off.

Use Map:
	Use a texture map for the root color. This is multiplied with __Root Color__.

Map:
	The path to the root color texture map.

Filter:
	The filter to use for sampling the texture map.

Filter Width:
	The width in pixels to use when sampling the texture map.

Tint Intensity:
	Controls how much influence the texture has over the final result.

==== Tip Color ====
Separate Tip Color:
	Set tip color separately.

Tip Color:
	Uniform value for the color of hair at the tip.

Use Map:
	Use a texture map for the tip color. This is multiplied with __Tip Color__.

Map:
	The path to the tip color texture map.

Filter:
	The filter to use for sampling the texture map.

Filter Width:
	The width in pixels to use when sampling the texture map.

Tint Intensity:
	Controls how much influence the texture has over the final result.

Root To Tip Blend:
	The gradient to use for blending the tip and root color along the hair curve.

==== White Hair ====
Use White Hairs:
	When on, hairs marked as 'White Hairs' by the __Fur__ object will uses this color, ignoring the above Root/Tip color settings.

Color:
	The actual color to use for 'White Hairs'

==== Guard Hairs ====
Use Guard Hairs:
	Tint hairs marked as 'Guard Hair' by the __Fur__ object with the below color.

Tint Color:
    Color to tint guard hairs with.

=== Reflection ===
==== General ====
Enable:
	Enable specular reflections.

Size:
	The size of the highlight, 1.0 corresponds to a specular angle of 180.

Shift:
    Shifts the highlight along the hair curve.

==== Intensity ====
Intensity:
    The overall intensity of the specular highlights.

Use Map:
	Use a texture to control specular intensity.

Intensity Map:
	The path to the intensity texture map.

Intensity Map Filter:
    The filter to use when sampling the texture.

Intensity Map Width:
	The width in pixels to use for the texture sampling filter.

==== Root Color ====
Root Color:
	Uniform color of specular reflections at the root.

    NOTE:
        This is used for both roots and tips if __Use Separate Tip Color__ is turned off.

Use Map:
	Use a texture map for the root color. This is multiplied with __Root Color__.

Map:
	The path to the root color texture map.

Filter:
	The filter to use for sampling the texture map.

Filter Width:
	The width in pixels to use when sampling the texture map.

Tint Intensity:
	Controls how much influence the texture has over the final result.

==== Tip Color ====
Separate Tip Color:
	Set tip color separately from the root.

Tip Color:
	Uniform value for the color of hair at the tip.

Use Map:
	Use a texture map for the tip color. This is multiplied with __Tip Color__.

Map:
	The path to the tip color texture map.

Filter:
	The filter to use for sampling the texture map.

Filter Width:
	The width in pixels to use when sampling the texture map.

Tint Intensity:
	Controls how much influence the texture has over the final result.

Root To Tip Blend:
	The gradient to use for blending the tip and root color along the hair curve.

=== Transmission ===

==== General ====
Enable:
    Enable transmission. This computes light entering the hair and exiting on the other side.

Intensity:
    The overall intensity of transmission.

Size:
	The size of the highlight, 1.0 corresponds to a specular angle of 180.

Shift:
    Shifts the highlight along the hair curve.

==== Color ====
Tint With Diffuse Color:
    When enabled, tints transmission contributions with the hair's diffuse color. This is usually wanted, since light that has been refracted through the hair should pick up the hair's color.

Tint:
    Multiply the transmission color with this value.

=== Randomness ===
Allows randomizing various parameters per hair. Note that __Set Hair Id__ needs to be active on the Fur object/Fur procedural for this to work.

NOTE:
    Using the same seed across multiple values allows you to create groups of hair with certain characteristics.

    For example, a ramp that moves from `[0,0]` to `[1,1]` in both Diffuse Intensity and Diffuse Saturation will produce dark, desaturated hairs and bright, colorful hairs, but no bright desatured hairs.

    If you use different seeds for the two ramps, the values won't be tied together, and every combination of dark, bright, desaturated, saturated will be produced.

==== Diffuse Hue ====

Randomize:
	Randomize the Diffuse Hue. The output range for this can be negative, -1 and 1 correspond to a 360 degree shift.

Seed:
    The seed to use for this ramp.

Output Range:
    The ramp values are mapped from `[0,1]` to this range.

Source Values:
    Randomly sample from this ramp.

==== Diffuse Saturation ====

Randomize:
	Randomize the Diffuse Saturation.

Seed:
    The seed to use for this ramp.

Output Range:
    The ramp values are mapped from `[0,1]` to this range.

Source Values:
    Randomly sample from this ramp.

==== Diffuse Intensity ====

Randomize:
	Randomize the Diffuse Intensity.

Seed:
    The seed to use for this ramp.

Output Range:
    The ramp values are mapped from `[0,1]` to this range.

Source Values:
    Randomly sample from this ramp.

==== Specular Intensity ====

Randomize:
	Randomize the Specular Intensity.

Seed:
    The seed to use for this ramp.

Output Range:
    The ramp values are mapped from `[0,1]` to this range.

Source Values:
    Randomly sample from this ramp.

=== Opacity ===

==== General ====
Opacity:
	Overall opacity.

Opacity Ramp:
	A root to tip ramp for opacity.
