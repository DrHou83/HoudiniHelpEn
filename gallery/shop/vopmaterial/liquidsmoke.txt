"""A diffuse material designed specifically for interior of volume liquids."""

@parameters

Smoke Intensity:
    This is an overall brightener/dimmer for the smoke color.  

Use Smoke Color:
    If this toggle is off, the smoke color is ignored.
    If both _Point Color_ and _Smoke Color_ are off,
    the default color is white.

Smoke Color:
    This is the color of the smoke.  

Use Point Color:
    If this toggle is on, the smoke color is multiplied by any point color.
    If both _Point Color_ and _Smoke Color_ are off,
    the default color is white.

== Density ==

Smoke Density:
    The overall density of the smoke.
    Higher values are more opaque smoke that reflects light faster.

Shadow Density: 
    This is the same as Smoke Density but is used in the shadow pass.  
    This controls how much light the smoke will block.

Receive Shadows: 
    If this toggle is on, the smoke tests for light visibility.  
    Enabling shadows also enables self-shadowing.  

    NOTE:
	For performance reasons, it is recommended to use Shadow Maps for shadowed smoke.

Illuminance Angle: 
    This is the angle of the cone, in which the smoke will test for shadows.

Bias:
    The cut off point for the depth field.  Any voxels with a depth
    higher than this cutoff will be given the full smoke density, any
    voxels with less than this will get 0.  Normally signed distance
    fields have the inside/outside cut off at 0, but mantra clips 0
    regions of the volume, so for greater accuracy it is useful to
    bias the smoke values by at least one voxel diameter.  Note that
    the same value as the bias needs to be added to the source depth
    field.

== Depth ==

Depth Field:
    The name of the volume to use as the depth field.

    The ramps use the range from bias to bias+max depth.  If your
    source depth field is a signed distance field, you will have to
    invert and bias it, ie -$V+0.1 to apply a bias of 0.1 with a
    Volume Mix SOP.  This is because signed distance fields use
    negative values for inside but Mantra will not render negative
    voxels to speed up rendering.

Map Depth to Density Color:
    The depth into the liquid is mapped to this color and then
    multiplied with the smoke color.

Map Depth to Density Opacity:
    Depth is mapped with this ramp to scale the final opacity of
    the smoke.  This value is multiplied by the Smoke Density value.
