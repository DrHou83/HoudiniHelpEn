"""This is a constant material showing the value of the surface normal's x y z directions in a red, green, blue color."""

This material is a constant shader and is not affected by lighting.
It is used to show the value of the surface normal's x y z directions in a red, green, blue color.
The normal is first normalized, to make sure all the values are between -1 and 1.
Then the values are shifted into the 0 to 1 range for colors. This way 0.5 is 0 and 0 is -1.

The __x__ direction of the surface normal, *N*, * is in the red channel.
The __y__ direction of the surface normal, *N*, * is in the green channel.
The __z__ direction of the surface normal, *N*, * is in the blue channel.
