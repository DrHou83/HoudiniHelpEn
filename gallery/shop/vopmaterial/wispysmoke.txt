= Wispy Smoke =

"""A wispy diffuse material designed specifically for volume objects."""

@parameters

Smoke Intensity:
    This is an overall brightener/dimmer for the smoke color.  

Use Smoke Color:
    If this toggle is off, the smoke color is ignored.
    If both _Point Color_ and _Smoke Color_ are off,
    the default color is white.

Smoke Color:
    This is the color of the smoke.  

Use Point Color:
    If this toggle is on, the smoke color is multiplied by any point color.
    If both _Point Color_ and _Smoke Color_ are off,
    the default color is white.

== Density ==

Smoke Density:
    The overall density of the smoke.
    Higher values are more opaque smoke that reflects light faster.

Shadow Density: 
    This is the same as Smoke Density but is used in the shadow pass.  
    This controls how much light the smoke will block.

Receive Shadows: 
    If this toggle is on, the smoke tests for light visibility.  
    Enabling shadows also enables self-shadowing.  

    NOTE:
	For performance reasons, it is recommended to use Shadow Maps for shadowed smoke.

Illuminance Angle: 
    This is the angle of the cone, in which the smoke will test for shadows.

== Wisps ==

Do Noise:
    If the toggle is off, the smoke will look like _Basic Smoke_.

Frequency:
	This value controls how "wiggly" the smoke wisps are.
	Low values give smooth wisps, where higher values result in patchy, more
    frantic wisps. See [voronoi|/nodes/vop/voronoise] for more information.

Offset:
	This vector positions the pattern in x, y, and z.
    This vector can be used to animate the smoke. As an example, 
    a positive `$T` times some speed value in y, gives the appearance the smoke is rising. 
    A positive value in x with a negative value in z (or vise versa) 
    give a swirling appearance. See [voronoi|/nodes/vop/voronoise] for more information.

Periodicity:
	This vector specifies how often the pattern repeats itself along each axis.
    Zero turns this off. See [voronoi|/nodes/vop/voronoise] for more information.

Wispiness:
	This value controls the size of the "holes" between the wisps. 
    Zero turns the wisps off and the smoke will look like _Basic Smoke_. 
    See [voronoi|/nodes/vop/voronoise] for more information.
