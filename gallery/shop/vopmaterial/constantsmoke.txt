= Constant Smoke =

"""A diffuse unlit material designed specifically for volume objects."""

This material just applies the smoke color and density values.  It
also multiplies in any point colors, so a light field can be
specified by having a `Cd.[xyz]` volumes present.

@parameters

Smoke Color:
    This is the color of the smoke.  

Smoke Density:
    The overall density of the smoke.
    Higher values are more opaque smoke that reflects light faster.
