= Uniform Volume =

"""Renders a closed surface as a volume consisting of a uniform fog."""

This material provides a fast and efficient way to turn a normal surface geometry into a fog volume.  For speed, it assumes the interior of the object has constant density and color.

The geometry must be a closed, manifold, watertight surface.

NOTE:
    This only works with raytraced rendering, not with micropolygon renders.

@parameters

Smoke Color:
    This is the color of the fog. It is constant throughout the object and cannot be varied.

Cloud Density:
    The overall density of the smoke. Higher values are more opaque smoke that reflects light faster.

Shadow Density: 
    This is the same as __Cloud Density__ but is used in the shadow pass. This controls how much light the smoke will block.

Scattering Phase:
    Controls how isotropic the bouncing of light from the fog is. 1 results in forward scattering, -1 in backscattering, and 0 is an equal isotropic scattering.  This only has an effect in PBR renders.

Receive Shadows: 
    If this checkbox is on, the smoke tests for light visibility. Enabling shadows also enables self-shadowing.  

    If PBR is used, shadows are always present so this has no effect.

    NOTE:
	For performance reasons, it is recommended to use Shadow Maps for
	shadowed smoke.
