"""This is a constant material used to verify an objects texture coordinates."""

This material is a constant shader and is not affected by lighting.
It is used to verify an object's texture coordinates.
The _U_ coordinate or global _s_ is in the red channel.
The _V_ coordinate or global _t_ is in the green channel.

@parameters

Blue Channel:
	This parameter is used to set the blue channel.
	The default is 1, since it makes the results easier to see. 
	However having the blue at 0, can make the __s__ and __t__ values easier to visualize.

== Texture Map ==

Use Texture Map:
	Allows the use of a texture map, which may further help in the visualization 
	of the _s_ and _t_ coordinates.

Texture Map:
	A texture map which will be composited over the UV colors.  Defaults to 
	grid.rat

Map Opacity:
	Used to fade the texture map.
