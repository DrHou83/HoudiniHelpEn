= Billowy Smoke =

"""A billowy diffuse material designed specifically for volume objects."""

NOTE:
    The volume noise will not affect the opacity of the volume. The shader changes the reflectivity, not the density by the noise.

@parameters

Smoke Intensity:
    This is an overall brightener/dimmer for the smoke color.  

Use Smoke Color:
    If this toggle is off, the smoke color is ignored.
    If both _Point Color_ and _Smoke Color_ are off,
    the default color is white.

Smoke Color:
    This is the color of the smoke.  

Use Point Color:
    If this toggle is on, the smoke color is multiplied by any point color.
    If both _Point Color_ and _Smoke Color_ are off,
    the default color is white.

== Density ==

Density Field:
    The name of the volume to use as the density field.

Smoke Density:
    The overall density of the smoke.
    Higher values are more opaque smoke that reflects light faster.

Shadow Density: 
    This is the same as __Smoke Density__ but is used in the shadow pass.  
    This controls how much light the smoke will block.

Receive Shadows: 
    If this toggle is on, the smoke tests for light visibility.  
    Enabling shadows also enables self-shadowing.  

    NOTE:
	For performance reasons, it is recommended to use Shadow Maps for shadowed smoke.

Illuminance Angle: 
    This is the angle of the cone, in which the smoke will test for shadows.

== Noise ==

Do Noise:
    If the toggle is off, the smoke will look like _Basic Smoke_.

Frequency:
	The scale of the noise pattern. Larger values give smaller,
	but not more detailed, patterns. Smaller values will benefit
	from higher _Turbulence_ numbers.
	See [aanoise|/nodes/vop/aanoise] for more information.

Amplitude:
	The bounds of the [noise function|/nodes/vop/aanoise] are multiplied by this value.
	The _Density_ is multiplied by the resultant value. 
    This then affects the opacity of the smoke.
	See [aanoise|/nodes/vop/aanoise] for more information.

Offset:
	This vector positions the noise on the object in x, y and z.
	An additional w parameter is provided to allow animating the
	noise over time.
	See [aanoise|/nodes/vop/aanoise] for more information.

Roughness:
	This value sharpens or softens the edges of the noise.
	Lower values are softer, higher values sharper. 
	Sharper edges may cause aliasing issues in motion.
	See [aanoise|/nodes/vop/aanoise] for more information.

Turbulence:
	This value controls the amount of details in the noise. 
	This is the number of times the noise function is called and summed.
	If the _Frequency_ is high, there is no need for much detail, 1 or 2 should be plenty.
	This can effects the _Amplitude_ of the noise as well since the summing
	will result in higher base values.
	See [aanoise|/nodes/vop/aanoise] for more information.

== Temperature ==

Temperature Field:
    The name of the volume to use as the temperature field. You can choose the field from the drop down menu.

    The maps take the 0-1 interval of the source field.  If your
    field isn't in this range, you may need to prescale the fields
    accordingly.

Emission:
    Scale of how much light to emit.  This is multiplied by the
    emission color, so if the emission color is black, no light is
    emitted.  This allows a global scale of the amount of light so the
    temperature map can remain in a nice range.

Map Temperature to Emission Color:
    Temperature is mapped with this ramp to determine the light
    emitted per voxel.  Emitted light does not have any opacity so it will
    will blow out rather than become opaque.

Map Temperature to Density Color:
    Temperature is mapped with this ramp to determine a color for the
    smoke.  This is multiplied with the __Smoke Color__ option to get the
    final smoke color.

Map Temperature to Density Opacity:
    Temperature is mapped with this ramp to scale the final opacity of
    the smoke.  This value is multiplied by the __Smoke Density__ value.
