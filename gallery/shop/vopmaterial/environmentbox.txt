= Environment Box =

"""A constant material with color ramps or color maps or environment maps to be used on a box surrounding the scene to ray trace against."""

This material is a constant shader and is not affected by lighting.
It uses the angle between the camera and the surface normal, to select 
a color or a map location.

@parameters

Overall Tint:
    The color is multiplied by whatever combination of ramps and maps or
    environments are selected below.

Tint with Point Color:
    If this box is checked and the point color, (`Cd`), is defined, 
    then `Cd` is multiplied with the _Overall Tint Color_.  Defaults to on.

Opacity:
    The opacity color.

Alpha:
    The alpha value for the box, such that another larger box could be seen
    behind the first.

Rotation Angles:
    Rotates whatever combination of ramps and maps or environments 
    are selected below, in _x_, _y_ and/or _z_.

Translation:
    Shifts over whatever combination of ramps and maps or environments 
    are selected below, in _x_, _y_ and/or _z_.

Use Environment Map:
    If this toggle is on, the [map|/nodes/vop/envmap] specified below is used 
    instead of the any selected ramps and/or maps.

== Env Map ==

Environment Map:
	This is the path to map used for the environment map. This defaults to _DOSCH_SKIESV2_01SN_lowres.rat_ which is an example of an HDR environment map that ships with Houdini.
      - See [how to create an environment/reflection map|/render/envmaps].

Env Map Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. See [envmap|/nodes/vop/envmap] for more information.
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Border Color_.

Env Filter Type: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used.
	See [envmap|/nodes/vop/envmap] for more information.

Env Filter Width: 
	This is the width in pixels used by the filter in both u and v directions.
	See [envmap|/nodes/vop/envmap] for more information.

Env Border Color: 
	The color used outside the map when Decal wrapping is selected.
	See [envmap|/nodes/vop/envmap] for more information.

Env Map Space: 
	The reflection ray used to do the look up in the map is transformed into this space.
	See [envmap|/nodes/vop/envmap] for more information.

== Color Ramp ==

Use Color Ramp:
    If this box is checked, the Color Ramp below will be used to affect the color of the material.  Defaults to On.

Color Ramp:
    The left-most side of the ramp represents the bottom of the material, and the right-most side of the ramp represents the top of the material.

== Color Maps ==

Map Mix:
    Values of 0 will reveal the Bottom Color Map, while values of 1 will reveal the Top Color Map.  The left-most side of the ramp represents the bottom of the material, and the right-most side of the ramp represents the top of the material.

=== Bottom Color ===

Use Bottom Color:
	If this box is not checked, the _Bottom Color_ is ignored.  Defaults to on.
	If _Use Bottom Color_, _Tint Bottom with Cd and _Use Bottom Map_
	are all off, the Bottom color is white.

Bottom Color:
	This is the color for the Bottom of the ramp. Defaults to blue.

Tint Bottom with Cd:
	If this box is checked and the point color, (`Cd`), is defined, 
	then `Cd` is multiplied with the _Bottom Color_.  Defaults to on.
	If _Use Bottom Color_, _Tint Bottom with Cd and _Use Bottom Map_
	are all off, the Bottom color is white.

Use Bottom Map:
	If this box is checked the _Bottom Color_ is multiplied by the _Bottom Map_.
	Defaults to off. If _Use Bottom Color_, _Tint Bottom with Cd and _Use Bottom Map_
	are all off, the Bottom color is white.

Bottom Map:
	This the name of the texture file to use for the Bottom color. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Bottom Map Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Bottom Map Border_.

Bottom Map Filter: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used. See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Bottom Filter Width: 
	Filter Width is the number of pixels, in both u and v directions, to use in filtering.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Bottom Map Border: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

=== Top Color ===

Use Top Map:
	If this box is checked the _Top Color_ is multiplied by the _Top Map_.
	Defaults to off. If _Use Top Color_, _Tint Top with Cd and _Use Top Map_
	are all off, the Top color is white.

Top Map:
	This the name of the texture file to use for the Top color. The icon to the right opens a file browser.

Top Map Wrap:
	Determines what the texture looks like when the texture coordinates
	are larger or less than 0 to 1. The options are:
	- Repeat means the texture will repeat (tile).
	- Streak means the texture color at the edges is clamped and streaks outside the map.
	- Decal sets the color outside the texture map to the _Top Map Border_.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Top Map Filter: 
	Type of anti-aliasing filter used. See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Top Filter Width: 
	Filter Width is the number of pixels, in both u and v directions, to use in filtering.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.

Top Map Border: 
	The color used outside the map if _Decal Wrap_ is selected.
	See [texture|/nodes/vop/texture] for more information.
