= Basic Liquid =

"""A reflective refractive material for liquids using ray tracing."""

This material must have an _Opacity_ (Of) of `1` for
refractions to work correctly. The _Alpha_ (`Af`) maybe be changed
to suit compositing needs.

@parameters

== Specular ==

Specular Intensity:
	A multiplier for the specular contribution to the material.

Specular Color:
	The specular highlight color.

U Roughness:
	This value controls the size or spread of the specular highlight. 
	If Anisotropic is selected, this value controls the specular 
    highlight in only the __U__ direction.

V Roughness:
	If Anisotropic is selected, this value controls the specular highlight 
    in only the __V__ direction. It is ignored with any other specular function.

Sharpness:
	This value controls the sharpness of the edge of the specular highlight. 
	It is used only if Glossy specular is selected.

Specular Type:
	A selector for the specular function.
	Glossy is typically used to get the sharp highlight common to glassy surfaces.
	See [specular|/nodes/vop/specular] for more information.

== Ray Trace ==

Reflection Intensity:
	A multiplier to dim or brighten the reflections.

Reflection Color:
	This is a tint color for reflections.

Refraction Intensity:
	This is a multiplier to dim or brighten the refractions.

Refraction Color:
	This is a tint color for the refractions.
    This is color is also known as the transmission color.
    Use this to color the glass or water. A little color goes a long way, 
    so something very pale (desaturated) might be be best to start.

Index of Refraction:
	This value is the ratio of the speed of light in one medium, such as air,
	to that of another medium. This determines how much the ray bends as it 
    passes from one material into another. Higher values tend to "push" 
    the reflections towards the edges. The refractions are in the center.

Environment Map:
	If there is the path to a texture here and ray trace is turned off, 
	then this map is used to calculate the reflection contribution.
	If ray trace is on and there is a texture, then the texture color is
	returned, when the ray does not hit anything. Without a texture here,
    the _Background Color_ is returned when the ray misses.
	It is recommended to have a texture path in this slot. The background
	image as a texture is a good choice to start.

Transform Space: 
	The reflection ray used to do the look up in the map is transformed into this space.
	See [envmap|/nodes/vop/envmap] for more information.

Background Color:
	This color is returned when the ray does not hit anything and there is no
	environment map specified.

== Blur, Density, Shadow ==

Ray Bias:
	This is typically a small number used to help 
    solve self-intersection issues.

Jitter Amount:
	This is a value between 0, no jitter and 1, maximum jitter. 
	It controls how randomly the _samples_ are distributed.

Attenuation Density:
    This is the density of the material. A uniform density is assumed.
    If this value is greater than 0, the opacity falloff is calculated
    based on this density and the square of the distance the ray travels
    inside a refractive material. The larger this value, the higher 
    the density of the material and the more opaque it will appear.
    Attenuation is only applied when the surface normal and the refracted
    ray point in opposing directions.

Attenuation Color:
    This color tints the attenuated opacity.

Cone Angle:
	This parameter is used by the PBR renderer. 
    This is size of the cone (in degrees) over which _samples_ are distributed.
    Any number greater than zero, will blur the refractions.

Samples:
	The number samples to calculate.
	The more samples, the better the quality, the slower the render.

Shadow Color:
    The color to use when computing shadow rays.

White Water:
    The amount of white water to mix in to the liquid.  This is an
    isotropic shader so adds all lights regardless of direction.  A
    point attribute called whitewater can be used to control this on
    per point basis.

White Water Color:
    The color of the white water.  Since all lights contribute
    equally, this might need to be reduced from white to 50% grey to
    avoid blowing out.

== Properties ==

Reflect Limit:
	This limits the number of [bounces|/props/mantra] for a reflection ray.
	Larger numbers equal longer rendering time and may not improve the images.
	See [render properties|/props] for more information.

Refract Limit:
	This limits the number of [bounces|/props/mantra] for a reflection ray.
	Larger numbers equal longer rendering time and may not improve the images.
	See [render properties|/props] for more information.
