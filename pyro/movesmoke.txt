= How to move smoke with an object =

# Create an [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD Object|/shelf/rbdobject].

# Create a smoke object using the [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|/shelf/smokebox] and [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_smoke][Smoke from Object|/shelf/smokefromobject] tools on the shelf.

# Turn off the display flag of your smoke object.

    In this example the sphere is the RBD object, and the torus is the smoke object.

# Dive into the [AutoDopNetwork|Node:obj/dopnet], click on the [Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] node and delete the path in the __Temperature SOP Path__ so that the smoke doesn't rise.

# Reconnect the [Gravity|Node:dop/gravity] node so that it only affects the object, not the smoke.

# Play this simulation.

     You will see the smoke wrap around the object and get pulled downwards as the object passes through. This is useful to simulate objects moving through smoke or clouds.
