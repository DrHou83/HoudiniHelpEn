= Visualizing the temperature field of a smoke object =

You can use the information attainted through visualizing the temperature field to determine how to modify parameters on the __Forces__ tab of the [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver].

== Visualizing hot fluid ==

# Create a [smoke container|/shelf/smokebox] with a [sphere|Node:sop/sphere] inside it. 

# Use the [Source from volume|/shelf/sourcefromvolume] tool on the __Volume Fluids__ shelf tab to make the sphere emit smoke.

# On the [Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject], turn on the __Show Guide Geometry__ checkbox on the __Temperature__ subtab of the __Guides__ tab. 

    This will create a grid that changes color to provide valuable information about the temperature of the simulation. Blue indicates a cooler temperature and red indicates a hotter temperature. This is useful for simulating fire and explosions.

== Visualizing cold fluid ==

You can also visualize cold fluid by changing a few parameters in the simulation.

# On the [Static Object|Node:dop/staticobject], change the __Temperature__ from 1 to -1. 

# On the [Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject], navigate to the __Temperature__ subtab of the __Guides__ tab and change the __Guide Range__ parameter from 0 and 1 to -1 and 0.

Blue indicates a cooler temperature and red indicates a hotter temperature, as in the first example.
