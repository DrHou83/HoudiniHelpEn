= Clustering smoke and pyro simulations =

== Overview ==

_Clustering_ partitions a large or sparsely-distributed smoke or pyro simulation into multiple (possibly overlapping) fluid boxes instead of one giant box.

Using multiple small boxes has several advantages:

* Can be distributed to multiple processes and/or machines on a farm.

* Solves faster since they computer doesn't have to deal with the empty spaces between the important parts of the overall simulation.

* The small boxes can be much higher resolution, or multiple resolutions, whereas a giant box usually must have a lower resolution because of memory limitations.

The multiple containers created by these tools are _separate simulation objects_ with _no interaction between each other_. For example, density cannot move out of one container into an adjacent one. This is usually not a problem smoke and fire simulations

== Creating a clustered smoke/pyro simulation from point sources ==

# Select the object containing the points you want to emit from.

    The smoke and pyro clustering tools *only work with point sources*. (This is because they use [point clustering|Node:sop/clusterpoints] to partition the source.) If you select surfaces or volumes instead of pure points, the tool will first add a [Scatter node|Node:sop/scatter] to scatter points across/through the surfaces/volumes.

# On the __Pyro FX__ shelf tab, click [Icon:SHELF/smokecluster] Smoke Cluster or [Icon:SHELF/pyrocluster] Pyro Cluster.

    * Inside the object's geometry network, the tool creates a [Icon:SOP/clusterpoints][Cluster Points surface node|Node:sop/clusterpoints] to partition the points. The clustering branches off into nodes operating on the "instance points" (the points that will emit smoke/fire) and "cluster points" (the points on which the containers will be centered).
    
    * On the "instance point" branch it creates a [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source][Fluid Source node|Node:sop/fluidsource] to turn the points into fluid sources.

    * In the DOP network, the tool creates a regular [pyro node setup|pyro]. On the [Smoke object|Node:dop/smokeobject], it turns on __Create objects from points__ (on the __Instancing__ tab) and imports the cluster points from the geometry network.

# To change the number of containers, in the geometry network select the [Icon:SOP/clusterpoints][Cluster Points node|Node:sop/clusterpoints] and change the __Clusters__ parameter.

# Sourcing from points gives very thin smoke. The following controls will let you increase the source (in descending order of usefulness):

    * In the geometry network, on the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source][Fluid Source node|Node:sop/fluidsource], in the __Scalar volumes > Stamp points__ sub-tab, increase the __Sample distance__. This is the radius around each point which will be added to the source field.
    
    * In the dynamics network, on the [Icon:SOP/volume][Source Volume node|Node:dop/sourcevolume], you can increase the __Scale source volume__ parameter to increase the output of the source.
    
    * Increase the number of scattered points before clustering.

== Clustering animated point sources ==

It is possible to use clustering with an animated number of points, but it
requires a couple of tricks to get the cluster boxes to appear as the points
are created.

Load `$HFS/help/examples/nodes/sop/clusterpoints/AnimatedSourcePoints.hda`
for an example of how to set this up.
