= Copy stamping =


== Overview ==

NOTE:
    Copy stamping is no longer the recommended way to create variations when copying to points. [Using a For-each loop and attributes|copytopoints#foreach] instead is more efficient, easier to set up, and easier and understand.

The Copy to Points tool creates copies of a piece of source geometry on each point of a piece of template geometry. By default these copies are identical, but you can use _stamping parameters_ to vary the generation of each copy.

Stamping parameters let you communicate information _upstream_ to the operators connected to its inputs. This lets you use values defined in the Copy SOP to control parameters on the source geometry as it is copied, even though the parameters are on operators upstream from the Copy SOP.

For example, to create a progression of polygonal spheres with increasing detail, you can define a stamping parameter on a copy SOP, and use it upstream on the source geometry to set the number of divisions.

Because stamping lets you modify the source geometry for each copy, it is not available when you are [instancing|instancing] (see [copying vs. instancing|/copy]). You can only use it when you are creating "real" geometry with the Copy node. (There are tricks you can use to vary instances, see [varying instances|varying].)

TIP:
    If changing parameters isn't powerful enough, you can create a [Python surface node|/hom/nodeuserdata], or use the [VEX surface node|Node:sop/vopsop] or [Script surface node|Node:sop/script]. These nodes let you write a script (or create a VOP network) to edit geometry, giving you total power over it.


== How it works ==

Copy stamping is a two step process:

- On the Copy node, create a stamping variable for each value you want to vary per-copy.

    # Select the Copy node, and in the parameter editor, click the __Stamp__ tab.
    
    # Turn on __Stamp inputs__.
    
    # Use the __Variable N__ and __Value N__ fields to set up variable names and expressions computing a value for the variable.
    
- Once the variable is defined in the Copy node, use the [Exp:stamp] expression function in parameter expressions on the surface nodes that define the source geometry.

    For example, to vary the size of the copies, you could create a stamping variable named `size` and use it in the __Scale__ parameter of a [Icon:SOP/xform] [Transform node|Node:sop/xform] in the source geometry network.

NOTE:
    Be careful naming stamping parameters. They may conflict with predefined parameter names on the input operators.


== Stamping using materials ==

You can also use stamping with [materials|/shade/] that you apply to your geometry. 

# Set up a [Copy|Node:sop/copy] node.

# Assign a material to the source geometry using a [Material node|Node:sop/material].

# In the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] of your Copy node, set Variables and Values on the __Stamp__ tab and turn on __Stamp inputs__.

# In the parameters of the Material node, click the plus button beside __Local Parameters__.

# Choose the parameter you want to override from the __Choose Parameter__ drop-down menu.

# Use the [stamp|Exp:stamp] function to grab the per copy values from the copy node.
