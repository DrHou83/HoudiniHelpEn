== Color sampling ==

VEX has several functions for sampling a color from an input image in a compositing node:

[Vex:cinput] |
    Samples the exact pixel color at the given coordinates from an input image.

[Vex:binput] |
    Samples a 2x2 grid of pixels around the given coordinates and returns the bilinearly interpolated color.

[Vex:finput] |
    Returns a _fully filtered_ sampled color at the given coordinates.

Use point sampled input functions whenever you are modifying discrete pixel
values, since these functions are much faster.

Use filtered functions whenever you are manipulating UV coordinates.

If you are reading and combinging multiple subsamples,
bilinear lookups can produce a similar result to [Vex:finput] but much
faster.


== Multi-pixel sampling ==

The [Vex:ninput] function reads the red, green, blue, or alpha component from all pixels in a 9x9 grid. This may be useful for building image manipulation kernels.
