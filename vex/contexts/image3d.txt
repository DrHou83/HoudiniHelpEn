"""Obsolete. Write a program for use with the i3dgen program to generate 3D
textures."""

WARNING:
    This context is obsolete and no longer used in Houdini.
    Use volume primitives instead.

The Image3D context is used by the stand-alone program i3dgen to
generate 3D texture images. In turn, these 3D texture images may be used
by the texture3d() function calls in VEX to efficiently evaluate the 3D
texture images.

Any export variables in the image3d context will cause additional
channels to be created in the 3D texture map.
