= displace =

"""Define a displacement shader with a program that moves a point on a
surface before the surface is rendered."""

Displacement shading can be used to move the position of the surface
before the surface gets rendered. This lets you add fine detail to a
surface, but is not intended for modeling.

After moving a surface, you must typically re-compute the normals of the
surface. For surfaces which have interpolated normals (smooth shaded
polygons), you can use the computenormal(vector P, N, Ng) function to
approximate the "smooth" displaced normal.
