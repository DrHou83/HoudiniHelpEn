"""Returns the derivative of the given value with respect to the 3rd axis (for volume rendering)."""

:usage: `float Dw(float p, ...)`
:usage: `vector Dw(vector p, ...)`
:usage: `vector4 Dw(vector4 p, ...)`

:returns:
    Returns the derivative of `p` with respect to W.

    When rendering surfaces, this function returns 0.

In shading contexts, this is the change in the variable over the volume being shaded.
