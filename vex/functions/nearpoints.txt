:arg:opinput:
    The number of the input to the current node, starting with `0` being the first input.

:arg:geometry:
    The name of the geometry file to reference.  Inside Houdini,
    this may be "op:full_path_to_sop" to reference a SOP.

:arg:ptgroup:
    A point group pattern to limit the search to.  Can be a SOP-style group
    pattern such as `0-10` or `@Cd.x>0.5`.  An empty string will match
    all points.

:arg:pt:
    The position in space to find the closest point on the geometry to.

:arg:maxdist:
    The maximum distance to search.

:arg:maxpts:
    The maximum number of points to find.

:returns:
    An array of point numbers
    This will only search against points, not the surface locations of the geometry.
    Use [Vex:xyzdist] to find the closest point on surfaces or curves.
