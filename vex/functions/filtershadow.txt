"""Sends a ray from the position P along direction D."""

:usage: `vector filtershadow(vector P, vector D, float bias, ...)`

Sends a ray from the position <<P>> along direction <<D>>. The length of
the <<D>> vector represents the farthest distance considered when check
for occlusion.

Each occluding surface will be evaluated and its opacity will be added
to the total occlusion. The return code of this function is the total
occlusion of shaded surfaces between the point <<P>> and the point
specified by <<P>> + <<D>>.
