"""Removes a primitive from the geometry."""

:usage: `int removeprim(int geohandle, int prim_number, int andpoints)`

Removes a primitive in the geometry specified by `geohandle`.

If the `prim_number` is -1, nothing is done.

If `andpoints` is 1, the points that the primitive owns will also be deleted if there are no other primitives still referring to them.
