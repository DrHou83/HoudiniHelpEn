"""Removes a primitive from the geometry."""

:usage: `int removeprim(int geohandle, int prim_number, int andpoints)`

Removes a primitive in the geometry specified by `geohandle`.

If the `prim_number` is -1, nothing is done.

If `andpoints` is 1, the points that the primitive owns will also be deleted if there are no other primitives still referring to them.

NOTE:
    If some primitives are being removed with `andpoints` set to `0` and some are being removed with `andpoints` set to `1`, all of the primitives with `andpoints` set to `0` will be deleted before all of the primitives with `andpoints` set to `1`.
