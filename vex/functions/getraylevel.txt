:usage: `int getraylevel()`

Returns the depth of the ray tree for the current shading. If the
returned value is 0, this represents a ray from the camera to the scene.
If the ray level is 1, the ray represents either a reflection/refraction
ray. If the level is 2, then this represents a reflection/refraction
which appears in a previous reflection/refraction etc.
