"""Creates a vector4 representing a quaternion."""

:usage: `vector4 quaternion(matrix3 rotations)`

Creates a vector4 representing a quaternion from a 3x3 rotational matrix.

:usage: `vector4 quaternion(float angle, vector axis)`

Creates a vector4 representing a quaternion from an <<angle>> and <<axis>>. The <<angle>> is specified in radians.

:usage: `vector4 quaternion(vector angleaxis)`

Creates a vector4 representing a quaternion from a combined angle/axis. This is the normalized rotation axis multiplied by the rotation angle in radians.

There used to be a fourth form that took a rotation vector.  It has been renamed to `eulertoquaternion` and now takes radians.
