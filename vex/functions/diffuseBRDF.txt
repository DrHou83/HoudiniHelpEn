:usage: `float diffuseBRDF(vector L, vector N)`

Equivalent to clamp(dot(L, N), 0, 1).

:usage: `float diffuseBRDF(vector L, vector N, vector V, float rough)`

[Vex:specularBRDF], [Vex:phongBRDF], [Vex:blinnBRDF],
and `diffuseBRDF` return the computed BRDF for the
different lighting models used in VEX shading. You can use them in
custom [Vex:illuminance] loops to replicate the lighting models of the
corresponding VEX lighting functions.

See [Vex:specularBRDF] for some example code.
