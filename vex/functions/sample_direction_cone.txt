"""Generates a uniform unit vector, within maxangle of center, given a vector2 of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector sample_direction_cone(vector center, float maxangle, vector2 u)`

:arg:center:
    Direction in the center of the cone.  This does not need to be normalized.

:arg:maxangle:
    Maximum angle, in radians, away from `center` that any sample of the cone
    will be, so long as all `u` values are between 0 and 1.

:arg:u:
    Pair of numbers between 0 and 1.

Returns a unit vector, i.e. a vector of length 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` pairs of values in [0,1), the returned unit vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` on the surface of the unit sphere,
in the area within `maxangle` of the direction indicated by `center`.
