"""Generates a uniform unit vector4, given a vector of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector4 sample_orientation_uniform(vector u)`

:arg:u:
    Three numbers between 0 and 1.

Returns a unit vector4, i.e. a vector4 of length 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` vectors of three values in [0,1), the returned unit vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` on the surface of the unit hypersphere.
In other words, they will be uniform random orientation quaternions.
