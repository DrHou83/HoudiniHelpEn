"""Determines whether a two half-edges are equivalent (represent the same edge)."""

:usage: `int hedge_isequiv(<geometry>, int hedge1, int hedge2)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:hedge1:
    The integer representing the first half-edge.

:arg:hedge2:
    The integer representing the second half-edge.

:returns:
    `1` if `hedge1` and `hedge2` are equivalent, i.e. represent the same
    edge in the geometry. This is the case when either source and destination points
    of `hedge1` and `hedge2` are respectively the same, or source of each of `hedge1`
    and `hedge2` is the same as the destination of the other.
