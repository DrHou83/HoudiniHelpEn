[Include:_common#geometry]

These functions open a geometry file and return a list of points with the location <<P>> within <<radius>>, based on point positions found in <<Pchannel>>.  Only the <<maxpoints>> closest points within the given radius will be returned. The file name may use the `op:` syntax to reference SOP geometry in the OP contexts.  The <<Pchannel>> parameter indicates the attribute which contains the positions to be searched.

The `ptgroup` is a point group that limits the points to search.  This is a SOP-style group pattern, so can be something like `0-10` or `@Cd.x>0.5`.  A blank string is treated as matching all points.


@examples

Performing a proximity query:

{{{
#!vex
int[] closept = pcfind(filename, "P", P, maxdistance, maxpoints);
P = 0;
foreach (int ptnum; closept)
{
vector closepos = point(filename, "P", ptnum);
P += closepos;
}
P /= len(closept);
}}}
