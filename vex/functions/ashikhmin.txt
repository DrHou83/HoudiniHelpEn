An anisotropic `bsdf` similar to `phong()` but with independent controls for the highlight size along 2 tangent vectors.

:arg:exponentx:
    Phong exponent along the `framex` vector.

:arg:exponenty:
    Phong exponent along the `framey` vector.

:arg:framex:
    Highlight X direction.

:arg:framey:
    Highlight Y direction.
