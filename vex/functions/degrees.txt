:usage: `float degrees(float num_in_rads)`

    Returns the given radians in degrees.

:usage: `vector2 degrees(vector2 nums_in_rads)`
:usage: `vector degrees(vector nums_in_rads)`
:usage: `vector4 degrees(vector4 nums_in_rads)`

    Returns a new vector with the components converted to degrees.

Most VEX trig functions work with radians, but most users are more comfortable with degrees. You may want to convert from degrees in the UI to radians for internal use.
