"""Imports a variable sent by a surface shader in an illuminance loop."""

:usage: `int simport(string name, <type> &value)`

Imports a variable from the surface shader.

Mantra runs the shaders for a surface in a fixed order:

# Displacement
# Surface (possibly calling light shaders in `illuminance` loops)
# Fog (possibly calling light shaders in `illuminance` loops)

Once the displacement shader has run, you can use [Vex:dimport]
to retrieve exported variables from it. Once the surface shader
has run, you can use `simport` to retrieve exported variables
from it.

If the shader variable named by the first argument is defined and
exported, the function returns 1 and puts the value in the second
argument. Otherwise, it returns 0.
