"""Samples a Catmull-Rom (Cardinal) spline defined by position/value keys."""

To specify the curve using uniformly spaced value keys, use [Vex:cspline].

:usage: `float ckspline(float t, float value, float pos, ...)`
:usage: `vector ckspline(float t, vector value, float pos, ...)`
:usage: `vector4 ckspline(float t, vector4 value, float pos, ...)`

:arg:t:
    The position along the spline to sample.

:arg:`value`, `pos`, `...`:
    A series of pairs of key values and positions that defines the curve to sample.

:returns:
    The interpolated value at position `t` along the curve.

Computes a Catmull-Rom (Cardinal) spline between the key points
specified. The values are spaced according to the keys given. The domain
of the interpolant (t) should be between the second and second last key
value specified. The keys should be specified in ascending order or
results will be unpredictable.

Because of the nature of the Cardinal spline, the value associated with
the first and last keys will never be returned. However, these keys are
used to determine the shape of the curve on entry and exit. For
example:


@examples

:box:Find the value at position `t` along a curve
    {{{
    #!vex
    Cf = ckspline(t,
        {1,1,1},    -0.25,    // First key
        {.5,.5,.5},  0.0,    // Second key
        {.5, 0,.5},  0.25,    // Third key
        {0,0,.8},    1.0,    // Fourth key
        {0,0,0},     1.25    // Fifth key
    );
    }}}

    The Catmull-Rom spline defined by the above keys would be valid for
    interpolants in the range 0 to 1. The first and last keys are used
    solely to determine the slope of the curve at the second and second last
    keys.
