"""Sensor function to render GL scene and query the result."""

:usage: `int sensor_panorama_create(float time, vector pos, int size, float near, float far, string candidateobj, string includeobj, string excludeobj, int uselit)`

This function will render the surrounding environment using the GL render and
provides a handle to use for querying the results.

NOTE:
    Because this needs to render the scene, it only works in interactive sessions of Houdini.

:arg:time:
    The period in time when the render should be performed.

:arg:pos:
    The location in world space coordinates where the render should be performed.

:arg:size:
    The resolution of the performed render.

:arg:near:
    The near plane restriction.

:arg:far:
    The far plane restriction.

:arg:candidateobj:
    A bundle, group, or expression that represents what objects will be displayed if their display setting is enabled.

:arg:includeobj:
    A bundle, group, or expression that represents what objects will always be displayed.

:arg:excludeobj:
    A bundle, group, or expression that represents what objects will never be displayed.

:arg:uselit:
    Usually for AI purposes you want to not have any lighting as you are using
    color as a key to differentiate actors.  However, if you want to display
    what a creature sees, lighting makes things more visually accurate.
