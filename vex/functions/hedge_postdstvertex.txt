"""Returns the vertex following the destination vertex of a half-edge in its primitive."""

:usage: `int hedge_postdstvertex(<geometry>, int hedge)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:hedge:
    Input half-edge.

:returns:
    The vertex number of the vertex that comes after the destination vertex of the half-edge `hedge` in the primitive that contains `hedge`.
    Returns `-1` if the half-edge is not valid.
