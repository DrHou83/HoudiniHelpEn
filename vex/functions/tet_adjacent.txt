"""Returns primitive number of an adjacent tetrahedron."""

:usage: `int tet_adjacent(<geometry>, int primindex, int faceno)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:primindex:
    The primitive number.

:arg:faceno:
    The face on the tetrahedron.  Face 0 is the triangle that doesn't
    have vertex 0.

:returns:
    The primitive number of the tetrahedron opposite the given vertex.
    Returns `-1` f the primitive is not a tet or doesn't have an adjacent tetrahedron.

Use [Vex:tet_faceindex] to get the vertex indices of each face of a tetrahedron.
