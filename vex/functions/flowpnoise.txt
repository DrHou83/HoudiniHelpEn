This operator generates 1D and 3D Perlin Flow noise from 3D and 4D data.
There are two forms of Perlin flow noise: a non-periodic noise which changes
randomly throughout the N-dimensional space, and a periodic form which
repeats itself over a given range of the space. The periodic form can be
used to generate patterns which tile over N-dimensional space, such as a
noise-based texture map which repeats seamlessly.

The noise has a range of (0, 1) with a median value of 0.5. The
distribution of the noise depends on the dimension, with higher
dimensions approaching a Gaussian distribution of noise values.

Flow noise is very similar to Perlin noise, as in
[Node:vop/periodicnoise], but with an extra flow parameter.  The flow
parameter can be thought of as an extra dimension, but a dimension
whose period is always 1.  Moving through the flow dimension rotates
the noise vectors rather than adjusting slices through a noise space, which generates a more flowing appearance to the animation.

See [noise and randomness|/vex/random]  in the VEX language
guide for more information.
