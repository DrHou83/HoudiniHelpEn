"""Returns the primary half-edge equivalent to a given half-edge."""

:usage: `int hedge_primary(<geometry>, int hedge)`

Each class of equivalent half-edges has precisely one primary half-edge. In particular, a half-edge which is equivalent to no other half-edges is always primary. Primary half-edges are useful for accounting for each edge exactly once as each edge may be realized by any number of equivalent half-edges.

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:hedge:
    Input half-edge.

:returns:
    The primary half-edge `hedge` that shares the source and destination of `hedge` (possibly in reverse order).
    Returns `-1` if the half-edge is not valid.
