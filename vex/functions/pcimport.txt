"""Imports channel data from a point cloud inside a `pciterate` or a `pcunshaded` loop."""

This function is only valid while looping with `pciterate` or `pcunshaded`.

:usage: `int pcimport(int handle, string channel_name, <type> &value)`

    Imports data from the point cloud file into the given variable.

:arg:channel_name:
    There are two special channel names you can import:

    `point.number`:
        The number of the point being processed.

    `point.distance`:
        The distance of the point being processed from the query point.
        This is only available when iterating over unshaded points.

:arg:value:
    If the import succeeds the function overwrites this variable with the channel value.

:returns:
    `1` if the import succeeded or `0` if the import failed (usually due to the given channel name not existing).
