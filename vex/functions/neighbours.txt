= neighbours =

#type: vex

"""Returns an array of the point numbers of the neighbours of a point."""

:usage: `int[] neighbours(<geometry>, int ptnum)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

This is a simpler, array-based replacement for the combination of
[Vex:neighbourcount] and [Vex:neighbour].


@examples

This is roughly equivalent to the following code:

{{{
#!vex
int []
neighbours(int opinput, int ptnum)
{
    int     i, n;
    int     result[];
    n = neighbourcount(input, ptnum);
    resize(result, n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result[i] = neighbour(input, ptnum, i);
}
}}}
