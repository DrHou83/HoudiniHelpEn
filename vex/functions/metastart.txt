interest, at the position p."""

:usage: `int metastart(string filename, vector p)`

Open a geometry file and return a "handle" for the metaballs of
interest, at the position <<p>>. You can then use
[metanext|Vex:metanext] to move the handle to the next metaball for
evaluation, and [metaimport|Vex:metaimport] to query attributes of the
metaball.
