"""Reads a vertex attribute value from a geometry."""

:usage: `<type> vertexattrib(<geometry>, string attribute_name, int linear_vertex_index, int &success)`
:usage: `<type>[] vertexattrib(<geometry>, string attribute_name, int linear_vertex_index, int &success)`

    Unlike [Vex:vertex], this function does not have a version that takes a primitive number and primitive vertex number. If you have a primitive number and primitive vertex number, you can convert them into a linear index using [Vex:vertexindex].

[Include:_common#geometry]

[Include:_common#attribname]

:arg:linear_vertex_index:
    A linear index into the list of all vertices. If you have a primitive number and primitive vertex number, you can convert them into a linear index using [Vex:vertexindex].

:arg:success:
    The function overwrites this variable with `1` if the attribute exists and was read successfully, or `0` otherwise.

:returns:
    The value of the given attribute on the given point number.
