"""Generates a uniform vector with length < 1, given a vector of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector sample_sphere_uniform(vector u)`

:arg:u:
    Three numbers between 0 and 1.

Returns a vector of length < 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` vectors of three values in [0,1), the returned vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` inside the unit sphere.
