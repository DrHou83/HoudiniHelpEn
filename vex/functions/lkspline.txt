"""Samples a polyline between the key points."""

:usage: `float lkspline( float sample_pos; float value1; float key_pos1; ... )`
    
    Samples a polyline defined by a series of value/position pairs.
    This is useful for specifying a 1D data ramp.

:usage: `vector lkspline( float sample_pos; vector value1; float key_pos1; ... )`
:usage: `vector4 lkspline( float sample_pos; vector4 value1; float key_pos1; ... )`

    Samples a polyline defined by a series of vector value/position pairs.
    This is useful for specifying a color ramp.

If you just want linearly spaced keys, use [Vex:lspline] instead.

:arg:sample_pos:
    The position along the curve at which to sample.

:arg:`value<<n>>`, `key_pos<<n>>`:
    #id: valpos
    
    To define the shape of the curve, you pass a number of value/position pairs specifying the key points through which the curve passes.

    You must specify key positions in ascending order or the results will be unpredictable.

:returns:
    The value of the curve at the sampled position.

TIP:
    The [Vex:spline] function is a more flexible superset of this function.
