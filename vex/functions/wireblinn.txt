:usage: `bsdf wireblinn(vector tangent, float exponent, ...)`

[Image:/images/rendering/wireblinn.png]

Blinn function defined around a tangent vector. You can use this to produce the average specular illumination for thin wire-like primitives such as hair.

* `tangent` -- tangent vector along the hair.
* `exponent` -- blinn exponent.
