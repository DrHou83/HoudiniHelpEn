"""Gets the index of the bottom left of a volume primitive."""

:usage: `vector volumeindexorigin(<geometry>, int primnum)`
:usage: `vector volumeindexorigin(<geometry>, string volumename)`

:returns:
    The index of the bottom left of a volume primitive.
    For Volume primitives, this is always zero.  However, for VDB primitives,
    this represents the bottom left of their active bounding box of voxels.
    
    Returns 0 if `primnum` is out of range, the geometry is invalid, or the given primitive is not a volume primitive.
