"""In shading contexts, computes a normal. In the SOP contexts, sets how/whether to recompute normals."""

:usage: `vector computenormal(vector P, ...)`
    In shading contexts, computes the normal for position P using the cross product of the derivatives of P.

:usage: `vector computenormal(vector P, vector N, vector Ng, ...)`

    In shading contexts, computes the normal for position P using the cross product of the derivatives of P.
    <<N>> is the original surface normal and <<Ng>> is the geometric normal.
    This version "adjusts" the computed normal so interpolated normals will be relatively correct.

:usage: `void computenormal(int i)`
    (Obsolete) In SOP context, sets the hint for whether normals should be recomputed when `P` or `N` change (0=never, 1=automatic, 2=always).
