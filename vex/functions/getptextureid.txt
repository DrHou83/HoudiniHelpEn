:usage: `int getptextureid()`

Returns the ptexture id for the current face being shaded.  This will typically
be the same as `getprimid()` except in the case of subdivision surfaces.  For
subdivision surfaces, mantra splits non-quadrilateral faces into multiple
patches.  Each of these split faces is assigned a unique ptexture id.
