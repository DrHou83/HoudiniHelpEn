"""Samples an agent's animation clip at a specific time."""

:usage: `matrix[] agentclipsamplelocal(<geometry>, int prim, string clipname, float time)`
:usage: `matrix   agentclipsamplelocal(<geometry>, int prim, string clipname, float time, int transform)`

Evaluates the clip at the given time and returns the local transforms of the agent's rig.
Returns an empty array if `clipname` is not one of the agent's [animation clips|Vex:agentclipcatalog],  `prim` is out of range, `prim` is not an agent primitive, or `transform` is [out of range|Vex:agenttransformcount].
The `matrix` signature is more efficient than the `matrix[]` signature for sampling a single transform.

:arg:geometry:
    The name of the geometry file to reference.  Inside Houdini, this may be `op:full_path_to_sop` to reference a SOP.

:arg:opinput:
    The number of the input to reference.  The first input is number `0`, the second is `1`, etc.

:arg:prim:
    The primitive number.

:arg:clipname:
    The name of the animation clip.

:arg:time:
    The time (in seconds) to evaluate the clip at. If this time is greater than the [clip's length|Vex:agentcliplength], it will be wrapped around.

:arg:transform:
    Index of a transform in the agent's rig.


@examples

Sample the local transforms of the walk clip after 1.2 seconds.
