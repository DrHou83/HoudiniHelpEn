:arg:ignored:
    The last argument is always ignored.
    It is just there so you can change a prim/point/vertex call (which each have an element number argument) to a detail call by changing the name without having to change the arguments as well.

:returns:
    `0` if importing the attribute failed, or the value of the attribute on success.
