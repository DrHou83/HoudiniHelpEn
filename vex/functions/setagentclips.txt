"""Sets the animation clips that an agent should use to compute its transforms."""

:usage: `int setagentclips(int geohandle, int prim, string clip_names[], float clip_times[], float clip_weights[], string clip_transform_groups[], int clip_layer_ids[], int layer_blend_modes[], float layer_weights[], int layer_parent_ids[])`

This function can provide improved performance compared to using a combination of [Vex:setagentclipnames], [Vex:setagentcliptimes], and [Vex:setagentclipweights], and also allows layering animation clips.

:arg:geohandle:
    Handle to the geometry to write to. `geoself()` can be used to get a handle to the current geometry.

:arg:prim:
    The primitive number.

:arg:clip_names:
    A list of animation clip names.

:arg:clip_times:
    A list of times that the clips should be sampled at.

:arg:clip_weights:
    A list of blend weights for the animation clips.

:arg:clip_transform_groups:
    A list of transform groups, which specify the joints that each clip should be applied to.

:arg:clip_layer_ids:
    A list containing the layer that each animation clip is an input for.

:arg:layer_blend_modes:
    A list of blend modes for each layer. The available blend modes are defined in `$HH/vex/include/crowd_cliplayers.h`.

:arg:layer_weights:
    A list of blend weights for each layer. The blend weight is not used for the topmost layer.

:arg:layer_parent_ids:
    A list containing the parent layer for each layer (or -1 for the topmost layer). This specifies a tree of animation layers.
