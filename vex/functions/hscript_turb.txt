"""Generates turbulence matching the output of the HScript turb() expression function."""

:usage: `float hscript_turb(vector pos, int depth)`

Matches the output of [Exp:turb]. This function can be useful if you convert a workflow to VEX, or have VEX work in tandem with Hscript expressions, and need the turbulence to look the same as in an expression.

:arg:pos:
    Position at which to sample the turbulent noise.

:arg:depth:
    Number of fractal iterations of noise.

:returns:
    The range is usually within -1 to 1, but can exceed it depending on the depth. The maximum range is -2 to 2 for high depths.
