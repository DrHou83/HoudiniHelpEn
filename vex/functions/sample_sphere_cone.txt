"""Generates a uniform vector with length < 1, within maxangle of center, given a vector of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector sample_sphere_cone(vector center, float maxangle, vector u)`

:arg:center:
    Direction in the center of the cone.  This does not need to be normalized.

:arg:maxangle:
    Maximum angle, in radians, away from `center` that any sample of the cone
    will be, so long as all `u` values are between 0 and 1.

:arg:u:
    Three numbers between 0 and 1.

Returns a vector of length < 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` vectors of three values in [0,1), the returned vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` inside the unit sphere,
in the volume within `maxangle` of the direction indicated by `center`.
