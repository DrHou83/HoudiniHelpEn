"""Converts the argument from degrees into radians."""

:usage: `float radians(float num_in_degs)`

    Converts the number of degrees in the argument to radians.

:usage: `<vector> radians(<vector> nums_in_degs)`

    Returns a new vector with `atan()` applied to each component.

TIP:
    The VEX trig functions work with radians, but most users are more comfortable with degrees. You may want to convert from radians for internal use to degrees in the UI.
