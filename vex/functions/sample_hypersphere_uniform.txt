"""Generates a uniform vector4 with length < 1, given a vector4 of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector4 sample_hypersphere_uniform(vector4 u)`

:arg:u:
    Four numbers between 0 and 1.

Returns a vector4 of length < 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` vectors of four values in [0,1), the returned vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` inside the unit hypersphere.
