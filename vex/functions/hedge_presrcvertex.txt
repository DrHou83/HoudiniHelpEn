"""Returns the vertex that precedes the source vertex of a half-edge in its primitive."""

:usage: `int hedge_presrcvertex(<geometry>, int hedge)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:hedge:
    Input half-edge.

:returns:
    The vertex number of the vertex that comes before the source vertex of the `hedge` in the primitive that contains `hedge`.
    Returns `-1` if the half-edge is not valid.
