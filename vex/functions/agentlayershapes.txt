"""Returns the names of the shapes referenced by an agent primitive's layer."""

:usage: `string[] agentlayershapes(<geometry>, int prim, string layername, string shapetype)`

    Returns the names of all shapes that are referenced by the layer and satisfy the `shapetype` filter.

:usage: `string[] agentlayershapes(<geometry>, int prim, string layername, int transform)`

    Returns the names of all shapes that are referenced by the layer and are bound to the specified transform.

Returns an empty array if `layername` is not one of the agent's [layers|Vex:agentlayers], `shapetype` is invalid, `transform` is out of range, `prim` is out of range, or `prim` is not an agent primitive.

:arg:geometry:
    The name of the geometry file to reference.  Inside Houdini, this may be `op:full_path_to_sop` to reference a SOP.

:arg:opinput:
    The number of the input to reference.  The first input is number `0`, the second is `1`, etc.

:arg:prim:
    The primitive number.

:arg:layername:
    The name of one of the agent's layers.

:arg:shapetype:
    Whether to inspect `"static"`, `"deforming"`, or `"all"` shapes from the specified layer.

:arg:transform:
    Index of a transform in the agent's rig.
