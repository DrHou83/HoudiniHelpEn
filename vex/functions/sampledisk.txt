"""Warps uniform random samples to a disk."""

:usage: `void sampledisk(float &x, float &y, float sx, float sy)`

This function warps uniform sample values so that they are equally
distributed on a disk. The transformation attempts to preserve
stratification properties from the original samples.

:arg:`x`, `y`:
    The function overwrites these variables with uniform distributed points within the unit disk.

:arg:`sx`, `sy`:
    Uniform random values in the range [0,1], such as generated by [Vex:nextsample].
