"""Performs bilinear interpolation between the values."""

:usage: `float lerp(float value1, float value2, float amount)`

    Performs bilinear interpolation between the values.

:usage: `<vector> lerp(<vector> value1, <vector> value2, float amount)`

    Performs bilinear interpolation between corresponding components.

:usage: `<vector> lerp(<vector> value1, <vector> value2, <vector> amount)`

    Performs bilinear interpolation between corresponding components by specific amounts for each component pair.

:usage: `bsdf lerp( bsdf bsdf1; bsdf bsdf2; float amount)`
    
    Returns a BSDF that linearly interpolates between the output of the two given BSDFS.

:arg:amount:
    If the amount is outside the range 0 to 1, the values will be extrapolated linearly.

    If amount is 0, the first value is returned.  If it is 1, the second value is returned.
