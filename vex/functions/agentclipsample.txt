"""Samples a channel of an agent's clip at a specific time."""

:usage: `float agentclipsample(<geometry>, int prim, string clipname, float time, int channel_index)`
:usage: `float agentclipsample(<geometry>, int prim, string clipname, float time, string channel)`

Evaluates the clip at the given time and returns the value of the specified channel.
Returns zero if `clipname` is not one of the agent's [animation clips|Vex:agentclipcatalog],  `prim` is out of range, `prim` is not an agent primitive, `channel_index` is out of range, or `channel` does not exist.

For sampling the clip's transform channels, use [Vex:agentclipsamplelocal] or [Vex:agentclipsampleworld] instead.

:arg:geometry:
    The name of the geometry file to reference.  Inside Houdini, this may be `op:full_path_to_sop` to reference a SOP.

:arg:opinput:
    The number of the input to reference.  The first input is number `0`, the second is `1`, etc.

:arg:prim:
    The primitive number.

:arg:clipname:
    The name of the animation clip.

:arg:time:
    The time (in seconds) to evaluate the clip at. If this time is greater than the [clip's length|Vex:agentcliplength], it will be wrapped around.

:arg:channel_index:
    Index of a channel in the animation clip, as returned by [Vex:agentclipchannel].

:arg:channel:
    Name of a channel in the animation clip.


@examples

Sample a channel of the walk clip after 1.2 seconds.
