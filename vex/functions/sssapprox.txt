"""Creates an approximate SSS BSDF."""

:usage: `bsdf sssapprox(vector albedo, float meanFreePath, float roughness, float scale, ...)`

:arg:albedo:
    Average surface reflectance.

:arg:meanFreePath:
    Average distance between scattering events.

:arg:roughness:
    A value from '0.0' to '1.0' blending to an ideal diffuse transmission reflectance profile.

:arg:scale:
    Physical scale of the material. Smaller scale values will make the material more transmissive.

See [writing a PBR shader|/vex/pbr] for information on BSDFs.

Models SSS illumination based on an approximate reflectance profile.
