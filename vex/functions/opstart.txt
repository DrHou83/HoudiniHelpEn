:usage: `int opstart(string message)`

Inform mantra about the start of a long operation (operation start).  The string argument is passed to mantra and may be displayed in the IPR viewer.

The function will return a non-negative integer when successfully started.

The integer returned should be passed to `opend()` at the completion of the long operation.
