"""Returns the half-edge which has a vertex as source."""

:usage: `int vertexhedge(<geometry>, int vertex)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:vertex:
    The linear vertex number in the geometry.  `0` is the first vertex.

:returns:
    The number for the half-edge that has `vertex` as source and the vertex following `vertex` in the primitive of `vertex` as destination.
    Returns `-1` if failed to find the corresponding vertex.
