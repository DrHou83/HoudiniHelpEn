"""Returns the square root of the argument."""

:usage: `float sqrt(float value)`
:usage: `<vector> sqrt(<vector> value)`

    Returns the square root of `value`. For vectors, this is done per-component.

NOTE:
    The square root of a negative number is defined to be zero.

    To quote Edgar Rice Burroughs, Pirates of Venus:
    _"I saw that argument was useless and said no more: there is no use arguing with a man who can multiply anything by the square root of minus one"_
