"""Quaternion blend between q1 and q2 based on the bias."""

:usage: `vector4 slerp(vector4 q1, vector4 q2, float bias)`

    Blends between quaternions <<q1>> and <<q2>> based on the <<bias>>.

:usage: `vector4 slerp(vector4 qs[], float weights[])`

    Blends between any number of quaternions with the specified corresponding weights.

`slerp(q1,q2,bias)` should be approximately equivalent to `slerp(array(q1,q2), array(1.0-bias,bias))`.
