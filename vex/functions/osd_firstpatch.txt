:usage: `int osd_firstpatch(<geometry>, int face_id)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

For a given face in the coarse mesh, this returns the number of the first patch associated with the face.  Since each face in a hull may generate multiple patches, this function will return the first of the patches generated by the face.  See also [Vex:osd_patchcount] to find out the number of patches generated by the face.
