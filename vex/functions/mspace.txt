"""Transforms the position specified into the "local" space of the
metaball."""

:usage: `vector mspace(vector P)`

Transforms the position specified into the "local" space of the
metaball. This function is only valid inside the [Vex:forpoints] loop
construct.

An example use of this function would be to compute noise based on a
"rest" position... For example:

{{{
#!vex
forpoints(P) {
vector npos = mspace(P) - mattrib("rest", P);
nval += noise(npos);
}
}}}
