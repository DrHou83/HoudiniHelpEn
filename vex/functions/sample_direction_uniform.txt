"""Generates a uniform unit vector, given a vector2 of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector sample_direction_uniform(vector2 u)`

:arg:u:
    Pair of numbers between 0 and 1.

Returns a unit vector, i.e. a vector of length 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` pairs of values in [0,1), the returned unit vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` on the surface of the unit sphere.
