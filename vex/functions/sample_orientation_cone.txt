"""Generates a uniform unit vector4, within maxangle of center, given a vector of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector4 sample_orientation_cone(vector4 center, float maxangle, vector u)`

:arg:center:
    Orientation in the center of the cone.  This does not need to be normalized.

:arg:maxangle:
    Maximum angle, in radians, away from `center` that any sample of the cone
    will be, so long as all `u` values are between 0 and 1.

    NOTE:
        This angle is the maximum quaternion rotation angle between the orientation quaternion that the output represents and `center`, which is twice the Euclidean cone angle of the unit 4D hypersphere being sampled. A `maxangle` of π would sample all orientations, but only half of all 4D unit vectors; a `maxangle` of 2π would sample all 4D unit vectors.

:arg:u:
    Three numbers between 0 and 1.

Returns a unit vector4, i.e. a vector4 of length 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` vectors of three values in [0,1), the returned quaternion
orientations will be uniform random and continuous with respect to `u`,
in the region of orientations within `maxangle` of `center`.
