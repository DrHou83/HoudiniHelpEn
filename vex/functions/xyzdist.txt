"""Finds the distance of a point to a geometry."""

:usage: `float xyzdist(<geometry>, vector origin)`

    Finds the distance from <<origin>> to the closest point on the geometry.

:usage: `float xyzdist(<geometry>, vector origin, int &prim, vector &uv)`
:usage: `float xyzdist(<geometry>, vector origin, int &prim, vector &uv, float maxdist)`

    Finds the distance from <<origin>> to the closest point on the geometry,
    and also outputs the primitive number and UV coordinates for the closest point.

:usage: `float xyzdist(<geometry>, string primgroup, vector origin)`
:usage: `float xyzdist(<geometry>, string primgroup, vector origin, int &prim, vector &uv)`
:usage: `float xyzdist(<geometry>, string primgroup, vector origin, int &prim, vector &uv, float maxdist)`

    Finds the distance from <<origin>> to the closest point on geometry in the give primitive group.

Returns the distance to the closest point on the geometry.  This will find
positions on the surfaces of the geometry, not just point positions.

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:primgroup:
    The name of a primitive group or a pattern to generate a primitive
    group.  Uses the same semantics as a SOP group, so empty strings
    will match all primitives.  Attribute groups like `@Cd.x>0` can
    also be used, but note that the `@` may need to be escaped with
    a backslash in a [Snippet VOP|Node:vop/snippet].

:arg:origin:
    The position in space to find the closest position on the geometry to.

:arg:&prim:
    The function overwrites this variable with the number of the closest primitive, or `-1` if no primitive was found.

:arg:&uv:
    The function overwrites this variable with the uv coordinates of the closest point on the closest primitive.
    You can use [Vex:primuv] to sample an attribute value at this location.

:arg:maxdist:
    The maximum distance to search. Specifying this can speed up the function if it allows it to quit early.

:returns:
    The distance from the origin point to the closest point on the geometry.
