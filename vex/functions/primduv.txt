"""Returns position derivative on a primitive at a certain parametric (u, v) position."""

:usage: `vector primduv(string geometry, int prim_number, vector2 uv, int du, int dv)`

[Include:_common#geometry_output]

:arg:prim_number:
    The number of the primitive on which to measure the derivative.

:arg:uv:
    The parametric coordinates on the primitive at which to measure the derivative.

`du`, `dv`:
    Represent the derivative order to query.
    
    On a curve, the curve direction is given by `du==1` and the curvature is given by `du==2`.

    This only works on NURBS and Bezier curve primitives.

    <<du>> is currently ignored as it is meant to work with parametric surfaces.
