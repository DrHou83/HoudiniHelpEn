[Vex:specularBRDF], [Vex:phongBRDF], `blinnBRDF`,
and [Vex:diffuseBRDF] return the computed BRDF for the
different lighting models used in VEX shading. You can use them in
custom [Vex:illuminance] loops to replicate the lighting models of the
corresponding VEX lighting functions.

See [Vex:specularBRDF] for some example code.
