"""Strips leading and trailing whitespace from a string."""

:usage: `string strip(string value)`
:usage: `string strip(string value, string whitespace)`

Returns a string with the leading and trailing whitespace removed.  If
whitespace is provided, it is a string of characters that will be stripped.

This is also equivalent of doing both [Vex:rstrip] and [Vex:lstrip] on a string.
