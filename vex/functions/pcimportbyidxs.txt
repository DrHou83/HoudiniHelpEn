"""Imports channel data from a point cloud outside a `pciterate` or a `pcunshaded` loop."""

:usage: `string pcimportbyidxs(int handle, string channel_name, int idx)`

After a [Vex:pcopen] and a [Vex:pcnumfound], this can be used to extract specific search results from the found points.

This will return 0 if the channel doesn't exist.
