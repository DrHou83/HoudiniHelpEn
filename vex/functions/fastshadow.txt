"""Sends a ray from the position P along the direction specified by the
direction D."""

:usage: `float fastshadow(vector P, vector D, float bias, ...)`

Sends a ray from the position <<P>> along the direction specified by the
direction <<D>>. The length of the <<D>> vector represents the farthest
distance considered when check for occlusion.

Returns 1 if there are no occluding objects found, or 0 if the ray hit
an object in between.
