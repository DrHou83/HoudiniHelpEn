"""Rotates a vector by a rotation that would bring the x-axis to a given direction."""

:usage: `vector2 rotate_x_to(vector2 direction, vector2 v)`
:usage: `vector  rotate_x_to(vector  direction, vector  v)`
:usage: `vector4 rotate_x_to(vector4 direction, vector4 v)`

:arg:direction:
    Direction to which a vector along the positive x-axis, e.g. (1,0,0),
    would be rotated.  This does not need to be normalized.

:arg:v:
    Vector to which to apply the rotation.

Applies to `v`, the rotation that would move (1,0), (1,0,0), or (1,0,0,0) to
`direction` most directly.

In the case of `direction` being (-1,0,0), there are multiple distinct
rotations that would move (1,0,0) to (-1,0,0) with a
half turn rotation, so one is chosen arbitrarily, negating `v.x` and `v.z`.
In 2D, there is only one distinct rotation that moves (1,0) to (-1,0),
equivalent to negating `v`.  In 4D, the rotation where `v` is negated
is also chosen.

This is used by functions like `sample_direction_cone` and `sample_sphere_cone`
to rotate the cone centre from (1,0,0) to a given direction vector.
