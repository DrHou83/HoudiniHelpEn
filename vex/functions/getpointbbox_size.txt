"""Returns the size of the bounding box for the geometry."""

:usage: `vector getpointbbox_size(<geometry>)`
:usage: `vector getpointbbox_size(<geometry>, string pointgroup)`

    This is the same as [Vex:getbbox_size] except it only computes the bounding box of the _points_. So if a primitive has extents that don't have points (for example, the boundary of a primitive sphere), they will not be included in the box.
