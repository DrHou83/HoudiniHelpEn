"""Returns the volume of the microvoxel containing a variable such as P."""

:usage: `float volume(vector pos, ...)`

NOTE:
    This function relies on the fact that VEX "knows" that `pos` has
    derivatives (`dPdu`, `dPdv`, and `dPdz`).
    Passing a literal vector instead of a special variables such as `P`
    will return `0` since VEX will not be able to access the derivatives.

@examples

Return the volume of the current micro-voxel in camera space:

{{{
#!vex
volume(P)
}}}

Returns `0`, since the argument is not a variable VEX knows the derivatives for:

{{{
#!vex
volume({0.1, 2.3, 4.5})
}}}
