"""Evaluates local curvature of primitive grid, using the same curvature evaluation method as Measure SOPs."""

:usage: `vector getlocalcurvature(float s, float t)`

Returns 0 vector if the object does not have subdivision enabled, or has no displacement shader assigned.
Otherwise, the measured convexity and concavity will be returned in `x` and `y` components respectively.

:arg:s:
    Parametric S shading value. This should be passed from the `s` global variable.

:arg:t:
    Parametric <type> shading value. This should be passed from the `t` global variable.
