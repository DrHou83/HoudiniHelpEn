"""Computes the distance and closest point of a point to an infinite plane."""

:usage: `float planepointdistance(vector plane_pos, vector plane_normal, vector point_pos, vector &intersect_pos)`

Given a 3D point `point_pos`, and a 3D plane with `plane_normal` normal vector passing through a 3D point `plane_pos`, return the closest distance and closest position between the plane and the point.
