"""Generates noise matching the output of the Hscript noise() expression function."""

:usage: `float hscript_noise(vector pos)`

Matches the output of [Exp:noise]. This function can be useful if you convert a workflow to VEX, or have VEX work in tandem with Hscript expressions, and need the noise to look the same as in an expression.

:arg:pos:
    Position at which to sample the noise.
