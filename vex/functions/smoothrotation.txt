"""Returns the closest equivalent Euler rotations to a reference rotation."""

:usage: `vector smoothrotation(int order, vector r, vector r_reference)`

Returns the Euler rotations that have the closest values to <<r_reference>> while still describing the same orientation as <<r>>.
Typically, <<r_reference>> will be the rotations from the previous sample or frame.

The angles are in radians.  Use the `radians()` function to convert degrees into radians.

The rotation order is specified by the <<order>> parameter. Use the constants defined in `$HH/vex/include/math.h` (for example, `XFORM_XYZ`).
