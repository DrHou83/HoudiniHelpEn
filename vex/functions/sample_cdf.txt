"""Samples a CDF."""

See [Vex:create_cdf] and [Vex:create_pdf] for more information.

:usage: `int sample_cdf(float cdf[], float uniform_rand)`

    Returns the index of the sampled CDF.

:usage: `void sample_cdf(float cdf[], float uniform_rand, int &index, float &x)`
:usage: `void sample_cdf(float cdf[], float uniform_rand, int &index, float &x, float &pdf)`

    Writes the index of the sampled CDF and extra information to output arguments.

:arg:cdf:
    The CDF to sample from (created with [Vex:create_cdf]).

:arg:uniform_rand:
    A uniform random variable (must be in range <0,1>).

:arg:index:
    The function writes the index of the CDF element that was sampled to this variable.

:arg:x:
    The function writes the coordinate of the CDF element that was sampled to this variable.

:arg:pdf:
    The function writes the PDF of the CDF element that was sampled to this variable.


@examples

CDFs are useful when sampling from distributions. For example, a CDF of
light source power could be created. This would allow sampling
of lights with a probability based on power. This is an example of a
discrete CDF, where sampling selects among a fixed set of probabilities.
Such a CDF could be created as follows:

{{{
#!vex
// Iterate over all lights, sampling their power
int[] li = getlights();
float values[];
resize(values, len(li));
int nsamples = 256;
int sid = israytrace ? SID : newsampler();
vector s, pos, clr;
float scale;
for (int i = 0; i < len(li); i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < nsamples; j++)
    {
        nextsample(sid, s.x, s.y, "mode", "nextpixel");
        sample_light(li[i], P, s, Time, pos, clr, scale);
        values[i] += luminance(clr);
    }
    values[i] /= nsamples;
}

// Create a CDF of the power distribution
float cdf[] = create_cdf(values);

// Randomly select a light based on power distribution
nextsample(sid, s.x, s.y, "mode", "nextpixel");
int index = 0;
sample_cdf(cdf, s.x, index);

// Do something with the selected light
// li[index] ...
}}}
