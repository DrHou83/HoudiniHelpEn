"""Removes a point from the geometry."""

:usage: `int removepoint(int geohandle, int point_number)`
:usage: `int removepoint(int geohandle, int point_number, int andprims)`

Removes a point in the geometry specified by `geohandle`.

If the `point_number` is -1, nothing is done.

If `andprims` is 1, any valid but degenerate primitives, (for example, closed polygons with fewer than 3 vertices or open polygons with fewer than 2 vertices), that referred to the specified point will be deleted.  If `andprims` is 0, primitives will only be deleted if they become invalid, (for example, tetrahedra cannot have fewer than 4 vertices, and volumes cannot have zero vertices).
