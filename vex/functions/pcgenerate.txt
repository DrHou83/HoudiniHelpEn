"""Generates a point cloud."""

:usage: `int pcgenerate(string filename, int npoints)`

This function returns a handle to the point cloud with the specified name or
creates a new point cloud with the specified name and number of points.
Initially, the point cloud has no channels, but channels can be added using
[Vex:pcexport] in a [Vex:pcunshaded] loop.  Note that if pcgenerate() is called
with the name of a point cloud that already exists, that point cloud will not
be re-sized to contain the specified number of points.

Once a position channel has been established, call [Vex:pcopen] to query the
generated point cloud.  Note that calling [Vex:pcopen] will lock the specified
position channel.  Once a point cloud has been opened, it is considered to be
generated.  Calling pcgenerate() with the name of a generated point cloud is
similar to calling pcopen() and requesting 0 points: no points will be available
in a [Vex:pcunshaded] or [Vex:pciterate] loop.

This function only stores a point cloud in RAM. To write points to disk, use [pcwrite()|/vex/functions/pcwrite].

NOTE:
    We refer to the parameter as a filename to be consistent with `pcopen()`. The two functions share the same namespace. That is, if you call `pcgenerate("myfile.pc", ...)`, you can then query `"myfile.pc"` by calling `pcopen("myfile.pc", ...)` or `pcopenlod("myfile.pc", ...)`.

    This works the other way as well. If you call `pcopen("myfile.pc", ...)` and then call `pcgenerate("myfile.pc", ...)`, the `pcgenerate()` call will use the point cloud that is already loaded into memory through the `pcopen()` call rather than creating a new point cloud.
