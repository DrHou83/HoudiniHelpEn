"""Returns the list of vertices connected to a point."""

:usage: `int [] pointvertices(<geometry>, int ptnum)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:ptnum:
    The point number to get a vertex from.

:returns:
    An array of vertices that are wired to the given point. You should not rely on the numbers being in a particular order.
    
    If the given point contains no vertices, the array will be empty.
