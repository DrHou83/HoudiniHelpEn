"""Reads a component from a pixel and its eight neighbors."""

:usage: `matrix3 ninput(int opinput, int plane, int component, int array_index, int u, int v, int frame, ...)`
:usage: `matrix3 ninput(int opinput, int plane, int component, int array_index; float u, float v; int frame, ...)`

Reads the given component from the targeted pixel and its eight neighbors and returns them in a 3x3 matrix.
Note that this function only reads one component (for example, red, green, or blue) at a time.
To sample full color, you need to call the function three times with `component` set to 0, 1, and 2.

[Include:_common#opinput_arg]

:arg:plane:
    The index of the plane to read from.

:arg:component:
    The index of the component to read from. For example, 0 is red, 1 is green, 2 is blue in an RGB plane.
