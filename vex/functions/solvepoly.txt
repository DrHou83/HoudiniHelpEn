"""Finds the real roots of a polynomial."""

:usage: `int solvepoly(float coef[], float &roots[], int maxiter=0)`

:arg:coef:
    An array of coefficients of the polynomial.
    
    You must order the coefficients such that `coef[i]` should be `x^i`.
    *This is reverse of the order you would write the polynomial out normally*.

:arg:&roots:
    The function overwrites this array with the real roots of the polynomial,
    in ascending order.
    
:returns:
    The number of real roots.
