"""Add a clip into an agent's definition."""

:usage: `int agentaddclip(int geohandle, int prim, string clipname, string clippath, int keepref)`

This function adds a `.clip` or `.bclip` file saved from a CHOP (or generated
by an [Node:out/agent] ROP) to the definition of the given agent primitive.
Clips in an agent definition contains transform animation for driving the
agent's skeleton.

The channels within the clip should of the form `transform_name:channel_name`
where _transform_name_ is a string matching the values returned by
[Vex:agenttransformnames] and _channel_name_ is one of `tx`, `ty`, `tz`, `rx`,
`ry`, `rz`, `sx`, `sy`, or `sz`. The channels starting with `t` denote
translation, `r` denote rotation, and `s` denote scale. The resulting
transforms will be treated as _local_ transforms, such as those returned by
[Vex:agentlocaltransform] (ie. they are relative to the corresponding parent
transform in the agent's skeleton).

:arg:geohandle:
    Handle to the geometry to write to. `geoself()` can be used to get a handle
    to the current geometry.

:arg:prim:
    The primitive number of the agent primitive whose definition is to be
    modified.

:arg:clipname:
    The name to identify the clip. All clips in an agent definition must have
    unique names.

:arg:clippath:
    The filename of the `.clip` or `.bclip` file saved from a CHOP or generated
    by the [Node:out/agent] ROP. Use `op:full_path_to_chop` to directly refer
    to a CHOP in the scene.

:arg:keepref:
    When `clippath` refers to a filename on disk, this boolean flag indicates
    whether the external reference should be maintained when the geometry will
    be saved. If the reference is maintained, then the original source of the
    clip needs to be available when the saved geometry is used. Otherwise, a
    copy of the clip will be inlined when saving out the geometry so that the
    original clip is no longer needed.
