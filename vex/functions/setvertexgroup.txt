"""Adds or removes a vertex to/from a group in a geometry."""

:usage: `int setvertexgroup(int geohandle, string name, int prim_num, int vertex_num, int value, string mode="set")`

[Include:_common#geohandle_arg]

*To use a linear vertex index*, set the `prim_num` to the *linear vertex number* and set `vertex_num` to `-1`. Note that *this is different* from how most other vertex functions work.

:arg:name:
    The name of the group to modify.

:arg:prim_num:
    The number of the primitive containing the vertex you want to add/remove.

:arg:vertex_num:
    The vertex offset on the primitive of the vertex you want to add/remove.

:arg:value:
    `1` to put the vertex in the group, `0` to remove the vertex from the group.
    This is ignored if `mode` is `"toggle"`.

:arg:mode:
    Use `"set"` to set the vertex's membership according to the `value`.
    Use `"toggle"` to toggle the vertex's membership, regardless of the `value`.
