"""Initializes a sampling sequence for the nextsample function."""

:usage: `int newsampler(...)`
:usage: `int newsampler(int seed, ...)`

    Returns an initialized sampler sequence for use as the first argument
    to the [Vex:nextsample] function.

:arg:seed:
    You can specify a seed value for the sequence.
    Using the same seed will generate the same sequence.
    This can be useful when random sampling into a point cloud, for consistent results.
