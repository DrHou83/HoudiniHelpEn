"""Returns the next half-edges equivalent to a given half-edge."""

:usage: `int hedge_nextequiv(<geometry>, int hedge)`

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:hedge:
    Input half-edge.

:returns:
    The next half-edge equivalent to `hedge`, or `hedge` if there are no other half-edges equivalent to it.
    Successive calls to `hedge_nextequiv()` cycle through all the equivalent half-edges.
    Returns `-1` if the half-edge is not valid.
