"""Turns a flat array of floats into an array of vectors or matrices."""

:usage: `<vector>[]  unserialize(float values[])`
:usage: `<matrix>[] unserialize(float values[])`

    The inverse operation to [Vex:serialize]. This operation takes an array of float values
    and creates a new array of vectors or floats by taking each float and assigning it to the
    next component of the vector or matrix in the output array. For example:


@examples

{{{
#!vex
vector v[]
float  f[] = { 1, 2, 3,  7, 8, 9 };

v = vector(unserialize(f));
// Now v has a length of 2 and contains { {1,2,3}, {7,8,9} }
}}}
