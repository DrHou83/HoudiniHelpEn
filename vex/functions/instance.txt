Creates a transform matrix from the given arguments, using the same
method that the [Copy SOP|Node:sop/copy] uses to transform its
output instances. The instance is placed at point `P`, oriented
along the normal direction `N`, and, optionally, scaled by `scale`.  An
optional `pivot` parameter can be supplied as the local transformation point
for the instance.

The function supports two methods for setting rotation. The fist method
requires an explicit `up` vector, which should be tangent to `N`. This
`up` vector, along with `N`, is used to construct an orthonormal frame
in which the rotation takes place.
The second method uses an explicit orientation relative to the XYZ axis
to construct the frame.
