Creates a random number based on the provided seed.  The number will
be in the range of 0 to 1.  The same number is produced for the same
seed, so to vary the random number the seed should be varied.

Note that even the smallest changes in the seed value will produce
completely different numbers, so it may produce different results
on different operating systems or compilers.

If the result is a vector2, vector, or vector4, each component will be a
different random number.  Thus, if you have the code:

{{{
#!vex

vector	pos = 1;
float	seed = 0;

pos *= rand(seed);
}}}

`pos` will get different values in its `.x`, `.y`, and `.z` components.  If you wish a uniform scale, use the `float()` cast:

{{{
#!vex

vector	pos = 1;
float	seed = 0;

pos *= float(rand(seed));
}}}
