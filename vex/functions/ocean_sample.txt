"""Evaluates an ocean spectrum and samples the result at a given time and location."""

:usage: `vector ocean_sample(string geometry, int phase, int frequency, int amplitude, float hscale, float time, int mode, int downsample, vector pos)`

Evaluates the input ocean spectrum at the given time and position and returns the value specified by `mode`.  The input is typically the output of the [Ocean Spectrum|Node:sop/oceanspectrum] SOP.

:arg:geometry:
    The name of the geometry file to reference.  Inside Houdini, this may be `op:full_path_to_sop` to reference a SOP.

:arg:phase:
    The primitive number of the volume representing wave phase.

:arg:frequency:
    The primitive number of the volume representing wave frequency.

:arg:amplitude:
    The primitive number of the volume representing wave amplitude.

:arg:hscale:
    The amount to scale any horizontal motion in the ocean waves.

:arg:mode:
    The type of value to sample from the ocean spectrum, where 0 means displacement, 1 means velocity, and 2 means horizontal spatial derivatives.

:arg:downsample:
    The number of times to downsample the input spectrum before evaluation.  Each downsample level halves the resolution of the input.

:arg:pos:
    The position in object space at which to sample the evaluated ocean.
