"""Finds the closest point in a geometry."""

:usage: `int nearpoint(<geometry>, vector pt)`
:usage: `int nearpoint(<geometry>, vector pt, float maxdist)`
:usage: `int nearpoint(<geometry>, string ptgroup, vector pt)`
:usage: `int nearpoint(<geometry>, string ptgroup, vector pt, float maxdist)`

Returns the number of the closest point on the geometry.
This will only search against points, not the surface locations
of the geometry.  Use [Vex:xyzdist] to find the closest point on surfaces or curves.

-1 is returned if no point is found in the search distance.

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:ptgroup:
  A point group pattern to limit the search to.  Can be a SOP-style group
  pattern such as `0-10` or `@Cd.x>0.5`.  An empty string will match all points.

:arg:pt:
  The position in space to find the closest point on the geometry to.

:arg:maxdist:
  The maximum distance to search.  The operation can be sped up if it
  is allowed to quit early.
