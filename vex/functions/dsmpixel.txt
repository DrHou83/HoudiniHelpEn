"""Reads the z-records stored in a pixel of a deep shadow map
or deep camera map."""

:usage: `int dsmpixel(string map, string channel; int x, int y; <type> &values[])`

Each pixel of a deep shadow map channel has multiple values.
This function will extract the list of the values associated with
the channel for the given pixel.

Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
If the function fails, the <<values>> variable will *not* be modified,
and so may be left uninitialized.

A DSM will always have `Pz` and `Of` channels. The `Pz` channel stores the
z-depth associated with each record. The `Of` channel stores the opacity.
