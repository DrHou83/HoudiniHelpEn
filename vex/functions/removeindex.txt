"""Removes an item at the given index from an array."""

:usage: `<type> removeindex(<type> &array[]; int index)`

    Removes the item at `index` from `array` and returns its value. This is the same as `pop(array, index)` but has a slightly clearer name.
    
    A negative index counts from the end of the array, so `removeindex(array, -2)` removes the second-to-last item.
