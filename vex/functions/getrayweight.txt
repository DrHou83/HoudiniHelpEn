:usage: `float getrayweight()`

Returns an approximation to the contribution of the ray to the final
pixel color. Often, this is a better metric for judging contribution to
the final pixel color than [getraylevel|Vex:getraylevel]. However, this
relies on prior shaders giving good estimates on the contribution to
their shading (see [reflectlight|Vex:reflectlight]).
