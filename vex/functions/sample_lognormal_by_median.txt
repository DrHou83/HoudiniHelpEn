"""Samples the log-normal distribution based on median and standard deviation."""

:usage: `float sample_lognormal_by_median(float median, float stddev, float u)`
:usage: `float sample_lognormal_by_median(float origmedian, float origstddev, float minvalue, float maxvalue, float u)`

:arg:median:
    The median of the distribution.

:arg:origmedian:
    The median the distribution would have, were it not for `minvalue`
    and `maxvalue`, limiting the range.

:arg:stddev:
    The standard deviation of the distribution.

:arg:origstddev:
    The standard deviation (scale) the distribution would have, were it
    not for `minvalue` and `maxvalue`, limiting the range.

:arg:u:
    A number in the range [0,1).

`minvalue`,`maxvalue`:
    When given, instead of sampling the full log-normal distribution,
    the distribution with its range limited to [`minvalue`,`maxvalue`] will be
    sampled.

Samples the log-normal distribution with the specified `median` and `stddev`,
optionally with a `minvalue` and `maxvalue`.  To use parameters `mu` and `sigma`
of the underlying normal distribution instead of `median` and `stddev`,
use `sample_lognormal`.
Given uniform random `u` values in [0,1), this will return log-normally
distributed random numbers.  The return value will be monotone increasing
with respect to `u`.

The log-normal distribution is sampled by sampling a normal distribution
and exponentiating the result, giving a value that is always positive, so
this distribution is often used for generating random point scales.
