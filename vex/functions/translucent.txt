"""Returns a Lambertian translucence BSDF."""

:usage: `bsdf translucent(vector nml, vector ng, ...)`

    Returns a diffuse BSDF for the transmission direction. This can
    be used as a cheap alternative to subsurface scattering for thin surfaces,
    to allow illumination to pass from one side of the object to the other
    while also broadly diffusing the illumination like diffuse.
