"""Returns vertex indices of each face of a tetrahedron."""

:usage: `int tet_faceindex(int faceno, int vtxno)`

Returns `-1` if an invalid number is specified.

Returns `0` to `3` to refer to the four vertices of a generic tetrahedron.

:arg:faceno:
    The face on the tetrahedron.  Face 0 is the triangle that doesn't
    have vertex 0.

:arg:vtxno:
    Which vertex on the triangle to return, `0` to `2`.  Starts with
    the lowest number and follows Houdini's winding convention, ie,
    face 0 is vertices 1, 2, and 3.
