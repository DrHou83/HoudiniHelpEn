"""Finds the distance of a uv coordinate to a geometry in uv space."""

:usage: `float uvdist(<geometry>, string uvname, vector uv, int &prim, vector &primuv)`
:usage: `float uvdist(<geometry>, string uvname, vector uv, int &prim, vector &primuv, float maxdist)`

Returns the distance to the closest uv coordinate on the geometry in uv space.  This will find
positions on the surfaces of the geometry, not just point positions.

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:uvname:
    The name of a point or vertex attribute on the <<geometry>> to
    use as the uv space. The geometry will be unwrapped inplace based
    on this attribute.
    The attribute can be a 2D UV, 3D UVW, but also any vector attribute.

:arg:uv:
    The position in uv space to find the closest position on the geometry to.

:arg:prim:
    The number of the closest primitive.  -1 if no primitive found.

:arg:primuv:
    The primitive uv coordinates the closest primitive.  The `primuv` function
    can be used to evaluate attributes at that location.

:arg:maxdist:
    The maximum distance to search in uv space. The operation can be sped up if it
    is allowed to quit early.
