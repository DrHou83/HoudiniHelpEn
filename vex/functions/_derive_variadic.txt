== Derivatives options ==

Functions which compute derivatives take additional arguments to
allow tuning of the derivative computation.

:varg:extrapolate:
    #type: int
    #default: 0
    
    Whether derivatives are
    "smooth" across patch boundaries. In most cases this is true and if
    extrapolation is turned on, derivative computation should be exact
    for C2 surfaces. However, when the VEX variables are changing with a
    high frequency (for example, a high frequency displacement map
    causing high frequency changes to the P variable), extrapolation of
    derivative computation may cause exaggeration of discontinuities
    between patch boundaries.
    
:varg:smooth:
    #type: int
    #default: 1
    
    Adjust the magnitude of the
    differentials non-uniformly over patches. This will usually reduce
    patch discontinuities in displacement/textured shaders. However, in
    some odd cases you may want to turn this feature off.
