"""Prints a message only once, even in a loop."""

:usage: `void print_once(string msg, ...)`

Prints the string passed to the function exactly one time, even in a loop.
This is useful to print a message before the first iteration of a loop, without having to count iterations.

:arg:msg:
    The string to print. This string does support interpolating values.
    Use [Vex:sprintf] to generate the <<msg>> string if you need to include values.

:varg:global:
    #type: int
    #default: 0
    
    Normally, multiple instances of `print_once()` call sites
    will work independently of each other.  That is, if two separate
    call sites to `print_once()` are passed the same string, the string will be
    printed twice (once per call site).  With the "global" flag turned on, strings
    are checked across all instances of the `print_once()` functions.


@examples

{{{
#!vex

// Only print "Hello world" one time
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
    print_once("Hello world\n");

// Print a missing texture warning, just one time across all shaders
print_once( sprintf("Missing texture map: %s\n", texture_map), "global", 1);
