:usage: `bsdf phong(float exponent, ...)`
:usage: `bsdf phong(vector nml, float exponent, ...)`

    See [writing a PBR shader|/vex/pbr] for information on BSDFs.

:usage: `vector phong(vector nml, vector V, float shinyness, ...)`

    <<V>> represents the normalized vector from the surface to the eye
    (-normalize(I)). <<shinyness>> is the Phong exponent (typically around
    20 or higher). <<roughness>> represents the surface roughness (typically
    0 to 1).
