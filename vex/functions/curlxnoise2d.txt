"""Computes 2d divergence free noise based on simplex noise."""

:usage: `vector curlxnoise2d(float x, float y)`
:usage: `vector curlxnoise2d(vector xyt)`

Computes a divergence free vector field based on the cross product of the derivatives of two simplex noise functions.

The resulting vectors all lie along the X-Y plane.

NOTE:
    This is not the same as projecting a `curlnoise` to a plane!

See [noise and randomness|/vex/random]  in the VEX language
guide for more information.
