"""Returns the derivative of the given value with respect to V."""

:usage: `float Dv(float n, ...)`
:usage: `vector Dv(vector n, ...)`
:usage: `vector4 Dv(vector4 n, ...)`

:returns:
    The derivative of `n` with respect to V.

In shading contexts, this is the change in the variable over the area
being shaded.
