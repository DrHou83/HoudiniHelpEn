"""Generates a uniform unit vector2, within maxangle of center, given a uniform number between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector2 sample_circle_arc(vector2 center, float maxangle, float u)`

:arg:center:
    Direction in the center of the arc.  This does not need to be normalized.

:arg:maxangle:
    Maximum angle, in radians, away from `center` that any sample of the arc
    will be, so long as `u` is between 0 and 1.

:arg:u:
    Number between 0 and 1.

Returns a unit vector2, i.e. a vector2 of length 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` values in [0,1), the returned unit vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` on the edge of the unit circle,
in the arc within `maxangle` of the direction indicated by `center`.
