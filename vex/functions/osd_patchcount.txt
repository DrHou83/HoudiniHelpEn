:usage: `int osd_patchcount(<geometry>)`

    Returns the number of base level patches in the subdivision hull specified by the geometry filename.  This is different that the number of faces in the subdivision hull.  For example, in a tetrahedron, each triangle face will generate three patches.

:usage: `int osd_patchcount(<geometry>, int face_id)`

    For a given face in the coarse mesh, this returns the number of patches which are generated by that face.  While a quadrilateral only generates 1 patch, all other faces will generate multiple patches based on their vertex count.  For example, a triangle will generate 3 patches, a pentagon will generate 5 patches.
