"""Finds a point by its id attribute."""

:usage: `int idtopoint(<geometry>, int id)`

Returns the number of the point with the given value in the `id` attribute. Returns `-1` if no point has the given ID.

If the geometry doesn't have an `id` attribute, point numbers are used as ids.  In this case, the function will return the given `id` value, unless it is greater than the number of points in the source geometry, in which case the function will return `-1`.

To look up a point by its `name` attribute value, use [Vex:nametopoint]. To look up a point by an arbitrary string or int attribute value, use [Vex:findattribval].
