"""Generates a uniform vector2 with length < 1, within maxangle of center, given a vector2 of uniform numbers between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `vector2 sample_circle_slice(vector2 center, float maxangle, vector2 u)`

:arg:center:
    Direction in the center of the slice.  This does not need to be normalized.

:arg:maxangle:
    Maximum angle, in radians, away from `center` that any sample of the slice
    will be, so long as all `u` values are between 0 and 1.

:arg:u:
    Pair of numbers between 0 and 1.

Returns a vector2 of length < 1, based on `u`.
Given uniform random `u` pairs of values in [0,1), the returned vectors will be
uniform random and continuous with respect to `u` inside the unit circle,
in the slice within `maxangle` of the direction indicated by `center`.
