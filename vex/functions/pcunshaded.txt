"""Iterate over all of the points of a read-write channel which haven't
had any data written to the channel yet."""

:usage: `int pcunshaded(int handle, string channel_name)`

Like [Vex:pciterate], this function can be used to iterate over
points which were found in a [Vex:pcopen] query. The first argument is
the <<handle>> returned by `pcopen`.

However, where `pciterate` iterates over all the points, this function
only iterates over points where the channel in <<channel_name>> has
not yet been written to.

The function returns 1 while there are points left in the iteration loop,
or 0 when there are no further points. This lets you use the function as
the condition in a [while loop|/vex/statement].

Warnings:

* This function will not work correctly when used in multi-threaded OPs.
It is not possible to nest `pcunshaded` or [pciterate|Vex:pciterate]
loops for the same handle. That is, for a single [pcopen|Vex:pcopen]
call, only one `pcunshaded` or [pciterate|Vex:pciterate] loop may be
entered.

* Computations involving derivatives inside `pcunshaded` loops may have
slightly different results. If derivatives are required for variables
which aren't set by [pcimport|Vex:pcimport] it may be better to
pre-compute the derivatives before the `pcunshaded` loop is entered.
