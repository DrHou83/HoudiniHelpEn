"""This function can be used to iterate over all the points which were
found in the pcopen query."""

:usage: `int pciterate(int handle)`

This function can be used to iterate over all the points which were
found in a [Vex:pcopen] query. The first argument is the <<handle>>
returned by `pcopen`.
The function returns 1 while there are points left in the iteration loop,
or 0 when there are no further points. This lets you use the function as
the condition in a [while loop|/vex/statement].

Warnings:

* It is not possible to nest pcunshaded or pciterate loops for the same
handle. That is, for a single [pcopen|Vex:pcopen] call, only one
[Vex:pcunshaded] or `pciterate` loop may be entered.

* Computations involving derivatives inside [pcunshaded|Vex:pcunshaded]
loops may have slightly different results. If derivatives are required
for variables which aren't set by [pcimport|Vex:pcimport] it may be
better to pre-compute the derivatives before the
[Vex:pcunshaded] loop is entered.
