"""Computes 2d divergence free noise based on Perlin noise."""

:usage: `vector curlnoise2d(float x, float y)`
:usage: `vector curlnoise2d(vector xyt)`

Computes a divergence free vector field based on the cross product of the derivatives of two Perlin noise functions.

The resulting vectors all lie along the X-Y plane.

NOTE:
    This is not the same as projecting a `curlnoise` to a plane.

See [noise and randomness|/vex/random]  in the VEX language
guide for more information.
