"""Samples a Catmull-Rom (Cardinal) spline defined by uniformly spaced keys."""

To specify the curve using unevenly spaced keys, use [Vex:ckspline].

:usage: `float cspline(float t, float val1, ...)`
:usage: `vector cspline(float t, vector val1, ...)`
:usage: `vector4 cspline(float t, vector4 val1, ...)`

:arg:t:
    The position along the spline to sample.

:arg:`val1`, `val2`, `...`:
    A series of of key values. The keys are assumed to be uniformly spaced along a range from 0 to 1.

:returns:
    The interpolated value at position `t` along the curve.

Computes a Catmull-Rom (Cardinal) spline between the key points
specified.

Because of the nature of the Cardinal spline, the value associated with
the first and last keys will never be returned. However, these keys are
used to determine the shape of the curve on entry and exit.
