"""Finds the closest position on the surface of a geometry."""

:usage: `vector minpos(<geometry>, vector point)`

    Returns the position of the closest point in the given geometry to the point.

:usage: `vector minpos(<geometry>, vector point, float maxdist)`

    Returns the position of the closest point in the given geometry to the point,
    within the <<maxdist>> radius.

:usage: `vector minpos(<geometry>, string primgroup, vector point)`

    Returns the position of the closest point in the given geometry to the point,
    limiting the search to primitives in the named group.

:usage: `vector minpos(<geometry>, string primgroup, vector point, float maxdist)`

    Returns the position of the closest point in the given geometry to the point,
    limiting the search to primitives in the named group and to the <<maxdist>> radius.

[Include:_common#geometry]

:arg:primgroup:
    If specified, only report points on 
    You can also use group specification syntax like `@Cd.x>0`,
    but note that the `@` may need to be escaped with a backslash in a Wrangle snippet.
    An empty string matches all primitives.

:arg:point:
    The point in world space to start looking for the closest point on the geometry.

:arg:maxdist:
    The maximum distance to search. Specifying this can speed up the function since it may allow quitting the search early.

:returns:
    The position of the nearest point on the geometry, or <<point>> if no nearest point was found.
