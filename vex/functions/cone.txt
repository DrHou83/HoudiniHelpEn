"""Returns a cone reflection BSDF."""


:usage: `bsdf cone(vector normal, vector dir, float angle, ...)`

    Returns a `bsdf` representing a cone reflection along a given direction vector. This BSDF is constant within the given <<angle>>, producing a similar result to the [Vex:gather] or [Vex:irradiance] loops.

:usage: `bsdf cone(vector dir, float angle, ...)`

    In shading contexts, fills in the current surface normal automatically.

:arg:normal:
    The surface normal direction.

:arg:dir:
    The direction of specularity.

:arg:angle:
    Cone angle *in radians*.
