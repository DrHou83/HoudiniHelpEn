"""Samples a polyline defined by linearly spaced values."""

:usage: `float lspline(float sample_pos, float value1, ...)`

    Samples a polyline defined by a series of (linearly spaced) values.
    This is useful for specifying a 1D data ramp.
    
:usage: `vector lspline(float sample_pos, vector value1, ...)`
:usage: `vector4 lspline(float sample_pos, vector4 value1, ...)`

    Samples a polyline defined by a series of (linearly spaced) vector values.
    This is useful for specifying a color ramp.

If you need variably-spaced keys, use [Vex:lkspline] instead.

[Include:spline#sample_pos]

:arg:value<<n>>:
    To define the shape of the curve, you pass a number of values specifying the key points through which the curve passes. The function automatically spaces the keys evenly.

TIP:
    The [Vex:spline] function is a more flexible superset of this function.
