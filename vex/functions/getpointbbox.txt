"""Sets two vectors to the minimum and maximum corners of the bounding box for the geometry."""

:usage: `void getpointbbox(<geometry>, vector &min, vector &max)`
:usage: `void getpointbbox(<geometry>, string pointgroup, vector &min, vector &max)`

    This is the same as [Vex:getbbox] except it only computes the bounding box of the _points_. So if a primitive has extents that don't have points (for example, the boundary of a primitive sphere), they will not be included in the box.
