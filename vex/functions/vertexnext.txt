"""Returns the linear vertex number of the next vertex sharing a point with a given vertex."""

:usage: `int vertexnext(<geometry>, int linearvertex)`

:returns:
    The linear index of the next vertex sharing the same point with the given vertex,
    or `-1` if the vertex has no later shared vertices.
    (To go in the other direction, use [Vex:vertexprev].)
