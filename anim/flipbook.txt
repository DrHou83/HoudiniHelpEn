== How to create a flipbook animation ==

A _flipbook_ lets you quickly review the motion and timing in an animation. It captures an image of a viewport for each frame and then plays the images as an animation. This is must faster than actually [rendering|/rendering] the animation. You can also attach a sound file to test out how your shot is working with audio.

:task:"Render" a flipbook:
    Click the [Icon:TOOLS/flipbook] Flipbook icon at the bottom of the toolbox (on the left side of the viewer).

:task:Change the flipbook settings:
    Right-click the [Icon:TOOLS/flipbook] Flipbook icon at the bottom of the toolbox (on the left side of the viewer) and choose __Flipbook with new settings__.

Click __Accept__. Houdini writes out the frames to your computer's temporary storage directory. The flipbook opens in [MPlay|/mplay] . Use MPlay's controls to view the flipbook.


== Flipbook blocking ==

You can block out a shot with a flipbook and edit the blocking by dragging keyframes in MPlay.

# Set keyframes on all parameters on a character/object.

# Right-click the [Icon:TOOLS/flipbook] Flipbook icon at the bottom of the toolbox (on the left side of the viewer) and choose __Flipbook with new settings__.

# Turn on __Scoped channel and key frames only__ and __Enable block editing__.

# The keyframe images are highlighted on the MPlay timeline. You can select them with ((LMB)) and drag them along the timeline with ((MMB)).

  This lets you change the timings of the blocked out images and preview the changes without creating a new flipbook.

# When you are finished, choose __Tools > Export Channel Blocking__ in MPlay to apply the edited timings to your scene.


== Scripting flipbook generation ==

{{{
#!python
desktop = hou.ui.curDesktop()
viewer = desktop.paneTabOfType(hou.paneTabType.SceneViewer)

# Copy the viewer's current flipbook settings
flipbook_options = scene.flipbookSettings().stash()

# Change the settings however you need
# (for example, set the frame range and output filename)
flipbook_options.frameRange( (frame, frame) )
flipbook_options.output(filename)

# Generate the flipbook using the modified settings
scene.flipbook(scene.curViewport(), flip_options)
}}}

See [Hom:hou.FlipbookSettings] for information on the settings you can use.
