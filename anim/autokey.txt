"""Auto-key automatically adds keyframes for any parameters you change."""

Auto-key is like having Houdini automatically press ((K)) (keyframe) for you when you make a change. So, it automatically sets keys when you change parameters _with existing channels_.

This lets you scrub the playbar, move objects, pose characters, etc. without having to remember to set or commit keys. However, you can also accidentally create unintended keys/animation.

- To turn auto-key on or off, click the [Icon:PLAYBAR/set_key] Auto-key icon on the playbar, or choose __Edit > Preferences > Animation__ and use the __Auto-key__ option.

Auto-key is related to two other preferences under __Edit > Preferences > Animation__:

- __Auto-commit__ is similar to Auto-key, but controls whether Houdini automatically commits changes when a key already exists at the current frame.

    *Important*: when this option is on, when you (for example) key the position of an object, you must _change the time before you reposition the object_ for the next key. If you reposition the object _before_ you change the time, because of the auto-commit setting, you will have changed the keyed values.

- __Global set key__ controls whether Houdini automatically keys/commits all pending changes, or only the [scoped|scope] parameters.
