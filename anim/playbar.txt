== Overview ==

The playbar controls the current time displayed in the viewer, playback of animation and simulation, and the playback range. The playbar also displays keys on the [scoped channels|scope], and you can edit keys directly on the timeline. The background of the current frame number will change to orange when Scroll Lock is enabled.

== Transport controls ==

[Icon:PLAYBAR/frame_first] Go to first frame:
    #action: range_start
    
    Moves the playhead to the start of the current frame range.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/keyframe_prev] Go to previous keyframe:
    #action: prev_key
    
    Moves the playhead to the previous keyframe for the selected object.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/play_backward] Play in reverse:
    #action: play_bwd
    
    Starts playing the animation in the current frame range backward.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/frame_prev] Previous frame:
    #action: prev_frame
    
    Moves the playhead to the previous frame.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/stop] Stop playback:
    #action: play_stop
    
    Stops playing the animation.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/play_forward] Play forward:
    #action: play_fwd
    
    Starts playing the animation in the current frame range.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/frame_next] Next frame:
    #action: next_frame
    
    Moves the playhead to the next frame. At the end of the current frame range this wraps to the start.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/keyframe_next] Go to next keyframe:
    #action: next_key
    
    Moves the playhead to the next keyframe for the selected object.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/last_frame] Go to last frame:
    #action: range_end
    
    Moves the playhead to the end in the current frame range.


== Playback options ==

[Icon:PLAYBAR/set_key] Auto key:
    #keyfor: h.auto_key
    
    Toggles auto-key mode. When this is on, changing animatable parameters automatically creates a keyframe.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/realtime] Real time playback:
    Toggles real-time mode. When this is on, Houdini will drop frames to try to maintain the correct FPS. When this is off, Houdini will display every frame even if this is slower than real-time.
    
    Click [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser] to open the [Global Animation Options|/ref/windows/global_anim_opts] window to choose realtime playback options.

[Icon:PLAYBAR/play_loop] Loop mode:
    This pop-up menu lets you choose how/whether playback loops when it reaches the end of the frame range. You can choose Loop (repeat), Play once (stop at the end), or Zig-Zag (repeat forward then backward).

[Icon:PLAYBAR/audio] Open audio panel:
    #keyfor: h.audio_panel
    
    Opens a window with settings for audio playback.

[Icon:BUTTONS/chooser] Global Animation Options:
    #keyfor: h.global_animation_options
    
    Opens the [Global Animation Options|/ref/windows/global_anim_opts] window with settings for animation, including the total number of frames are in the current scene.


== Timeline ==

The timeline is a graphical representation of the current _frame range_. The current frame is highlighted with a black box. Keys on the [scoped channels|scope] appear as marks on the timeline. You can edit keyframes directly on the timeline using the ((Shift)) key.

[Image:/images/playbar/timeline_anno.png]

See [how key marks are color coded|basics#colors] on the timeline.

:task: Go to a specific frame:
    - Click or drag in the timeline to set the current frame.
    
    - Type an exact frame number in the current frame field.
    
    - Use the + and - buttons next to the current frame field to increase or decrease the current frame.
    
    - Click ((Shift + RMB)) in the timeline to flip between the last two frames viewed.

:task:Set the total number of frames:

    # Click [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser] to open the [Global Animation Options|/ref/windows/global_anim_opts] window.

    # Change the __End__ option and click __Apply__.

:task: Set the frame range:

    There are two frame ranges: the overall frame range is set in the [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser] [Global Animation Options|/ref/windows/global_anim_opts]. Within this range, you can use controls on the timeline to it to show and playback a subset of the total frame range. This lets you concentrate on subsections of the total animation.


== Editing keys on the timeline ==

You can edit scoped keys directly on the timeline without opening the animation editor when it's more convenient. Editing keys on the timeline is very similar to editing in the [dopesheet|/ref/panes/dopesheet].

The timeline only shows key markers for the currently [scoped|scope] channels.

:task: Move keys along the timeline:
    Hold ((Shift)) and click or drag to edit keyframes in the timeline. Holding ((Shift)) puts you in "editing" mode instead of moving the playhead along the timeline.

    [Image:/images/playbar/timeline_selection_anno.png]
    
    (You can keep holding ((Shift)) and select multiple ranges at the same time.)
    
    ((Shift + LMB)) |
        - Drag on the timeline to select a range.
    
        - Drag the selection to move it.
   
        - Drag the solid squares at either end to resize the selection.

    ((MMB)) |
        - Drag a range to move the selected keys.
    
        - Drag the solid squares at either end of the selection to scale the selected keys.

    ((Shift + RMB)) |
        Clear the timeline selection.
    
    ((RMB)) |
        Right-click the timeline to access a menu of commands for editing the selected keys. For example, you can delete keys on the timeline by selecting them, right-clicking and choosing __Delete keys__.

:task: Hold scoped channels:

    This is a quick way to copy the values of the scoped channels from one frame to another, such as when you want an object to ping-pong back and forth between two positions.

    # Go to the frame you want to copy the values _from_.
    # ((MMB)) Middle-drag the current frame marker to the frame you want to copy _to_. The values of the scoped channel appear not to change as you drag, but you will see an orange triangle and an orange key.
    # Press ((K)) to key the held values at the current frame, or ((LMB)) click another frame on the timeline to cancel the hold.

:task: Copy and paste keys:

    # Use ((Shift + LMB)) to select a range of keys, then right-click and choose __Cut__ or __Copy__.

    # Use ((Shift + LMB)) to select the range of frames you want to paste into.

    # Right-click in the timeline and choose one of the following...
    
    Paste:
        Copies keys from the clipboard into the current selection.
        
    Replace:
        Replaces the current selection with the contents of the clipboard.
        
    Stretch/Paste:
        Stretches the contents of the clipboard to fill the selection, if the new selection is a different size than when you cut/copied.
        
    Paste as cycle:
        Repeats the contents of the clipboard to fill the selection, if the new selection is longer than when you cut/copied.
        
    Paste as cycle with offset:
        Repeats the contents of the clipboard with offsets to fill the selection, if the new selection is longer than when you cut/copied.

:task: Paste keys visually:

    The _visual paste_ options on the context menu let you interactively position the paste location with the mouse, instead of selecting it first and then pasting. First, cut or copy a set of keys. *If you want to visually paste a repeat or cycle*, select a _longer range of frames than you have keys_ -- the range will be filled with repeats/cycles when you paste.
    
    [Image:/images/playbar/timeline_selection_extra.png]
    
    Right-click in the timeline and choose one of the following...

    Visual replace:
        Lets you interactively position the clipboard data on the dopesheet, replacing the current contents.
    Visual stretch/paste:
        Lets you interactively position the clipboard data on the dopesheet. Stretches the clipboard data to match the current size of the selection.
    Visual paste as cycle:
        Lets you interactively position the clipboard data on the dopesheet. Repeats the clipboard data to match the current size of the selection.
    Visual paste as cycle with offset:
        Lets you interactively position the clipboard data on the dopesheet. Repeats the clipboard data with offsets to match the current size of the selection.

    Use the mouse to position the pasted keys on the timeline. Shift-click to paste the keys, or press ((Esc)) to cancel pasting.

<!--
TIP:
    The [Exp:cycle] and [Exp:cycleoffset] expression functions let you fill an animation segment (the distance between two keys) with repeated/cycled copies of a range of animation from elsewhere on the timeline. However, this is just a function that produces a value when evaluated: it does not actually create keys. See the [channel graph|/ref/panes/changraph] for more information on setting segment functions.

@actions

Show/Hide Playbar:
    #action: stow_playbar

    Collapses or expands the playbar interface. This may be useful to gain vertical space in the main window when you're not working with animation.
