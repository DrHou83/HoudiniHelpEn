== Introduction ==

_Animation channels_ record how the value of a parameter changes over time. Houdini has several interfaces for viewing and editing channels:

* [Graph View|/ref/panes/changraph]

  You can view the value of the parameter graphed against time in the [animation editor's graph view|/ref/panes/changraph] , and then directly edit the graph to change the animation.
  
* [Table View|/ref/panes/chantable]

  You can view the value of the parameter at each keyframe in the [animation editor's table view|/ref/panes/chantable] .

* [Dopesheet|/ref/panes/dopesheet]

  You can work with blocks of keyframes at a time in the [animation editor's dopesheet view|/ref/panes/dopesheet] .

* [Channel list|/ref/panes/chanlist]

  You can put the channel list interface from the animation editor in its own pane.

  The  [channel list|/ref/panes/chanlist] lets you view and edit the values of parameters and create and edit channel groups. It also lets you control which parameters are _scoped_ (that is, appear in the [animation editor|/ref/panes/animeditor] ).
  
* [Animation Layers|/character/animlayer]

  You can create layers of animation to edit existing base animation. See [Animation Layer Mixer|/character/animlayer].
