= Channel groups =

_Channel groups_ are groups of selected parameters. You can select several parameters and group them together so you can easily select them again later. You can also build hierarchies of channel groups, so that selecting a parent group selects all the parameters in its subgroups.

Channel groups let you _scope_ (show in the [animation editor|/ref/panes/animeditor] ) and/or [keyframe|basics] different groups of parameters easily. For example, in [character animation|/character/] , you can set up a group for a character, with sub-groups for arms, legs, head, etc. Then while you are animating the character, you can quickly and easily select the appropriate groups of parameters to keyframe.

You create and manage channel groups in the [channel
list|/ref/panes/chanlist] , either embedded in the [channel
editor|/ref/panes/animeditor]  or in its own pane.

:task:Create a new channel group:
    # In the top pane of the channel list, select the existing group, if any, you want to be the parent of the new group.

    # In the bottom pane of the channel list, select the parameters you want in the group.

    # Press ((RMB)) on the selected channels and choose __Create Subgroup__.

:task:Create channel groups for all parameters on a character:
    * Press ((RMB)) on the character's object node and choose __Create Nested Channel Groups__.

      If you have organized the parameters of the character asset into tabs, Houdini will create nested channel groups corresponding to the organization of the parameters.

:task:Select and scope a channel group:
    * Click the name of the group in the top pane of the channel list.

:task:Rename a channel group:
    # Double-click the name of the group in the top pane of the channel list.

    # Type the new name and press ((Enter)).

:task:Add parameters to an existing group:
    # In the bottom pane of the channel list, select the parameters you want in the group.

    # Drag the parameters up to the top pane and drop them on the name of the group.

    # Click __Add channels to <<group>>__.

:task:Remove parameters from a group:
    # In the bottom pane of the channel list, select the parameters you want to remove.

    # Drag the parameters up to the top pane and drop them on the name of the group you want to remove them from.

    # Click __Remove channels from <<group>>__.


:task:Modify channel groups:
    Use the following commands:
    {{{
        chgadd newgroup
        chgop newgroup set `strreplace(chgroup("oldgroup"), "old_name", "new_name")` 
    }}}
    
    NOTE:
        Channel groups are global for the entire scene file. Copying a node will not modify channel groups.
