At the geometry (SOP) level, the output of a [Icon:SOP/particle][POP
network|Node:sop/popnet] provides points you can connect to other
geometry operators to create surfaces.

:task:Use particles as polygon vertices:
    * Connect the output of a [Icon:SOP/particle][POP network|Node:sop/popnet] to an [Icon:SOP/add][Add SOP|Node:sop/add] to create polygons.

:task:Create metaballs from particles:
    * Create a [Icon:SOP/metaball][Metaball node|Node:sop/metaball] and a [Icon:SOP/particle][POP network|Node:sop/popnet] and connect the to a [Icon:SOP/copy][Copy SOP|Node:sop/copy].
