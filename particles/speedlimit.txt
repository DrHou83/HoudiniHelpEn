= Limiting particle speed =

There are three ways to control speed of particles. You can use [Icon:POP/drag][Drag|Node:pop/drag], [Icon:POP/speedlimit][Speed Limit|Node:pop/speedlimit], or [Icon:POP/wind][Wind|Node:pop/wind].

:task:Apply [drag|Node:pop/drag] to particles:
       
    # Click the [Icon:POP/drag][Drag|Node:pop/drag] button on the __Drive Particles__ tab.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # Specify the node settings in the operation controls toolbar or [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

:task:Set a high and low limit on the speed of particles:
        
    # Create a [Icon:POP/speedlimit][Speed Limit|Node:pop/speedlimit] node and connect the particle flow to it.

    # In the __Speed limit__ parameter, set the minimum speed (the field on the left) and the maximum speed (the field on the right). Use a negative value to turn off a limit.

        The limits are not actually imposed until the particle is moved during post frame processing of its default velocity rule (see the [Suppress Rule POP|/nodes/pop/suppress]).

:task:Push particles up to, but not past, a certain speed:
    
    # Click the [Icon:POP/wind][Wind|Node:pop/wind] button on the __Drive Particles__ tab of the shelf.
            
    # Click ((LMB)) the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
            
        The Wind POP simulates a pushing force like wind, that can increase the velocity of particles but not past its own speed.

    # Set the __Wind__ vector. The direction of the vector controls the direction of the wind, and the length of the vector controls the intensity of the wind.

        For example, a value of (0, 1, 0) would create wind traveling straight down. A value of (0, 2, 0) would represent wind traveling in the same direction but twice as strong.
