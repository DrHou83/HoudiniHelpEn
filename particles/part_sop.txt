= Simple particle system (Particle SOP) =

For simple particle systems, you may be able to use the
[Particle surface node|Node:sop/particle] instead of creating
a [particle network|/nodes/sop/popnet].

The Particle SOP lets you quickly set up a simple particle system with one [emitter|/shelf/emitfromlocation], a single [collision|/shelf/collision] object, and a single [attractor|/shelf/attractor].

For more information on the particle surface node, see the [Icon:SOP/particle][Particle SOP|Node:sop/particle] node help.

== When to use a real particle network ==

* Large number of local variables to represent particle attributes.
* Control over attribute manipulation and inheritance.
* Event-based behaviors.
* Grouping of points based on rules or collisions.
* Support for per-particle rotation and instanced geometry.
* More birthing options.
* Multiple collision objects/attractors.
* Ability to customize a particle system's behavior with networks of
  pops.
* Ability to write custom POPs with the HDK.

== How to create a real particle network ==

There is a tab on the shelf called __Create Particles__ which allows you to create complex particle systems by simply clicking a button.
