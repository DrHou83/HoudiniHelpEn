= Follow a leader or leaders =

The [Icon:POP/follow][Follow POP|Node:pop/follow] makes particles follow a leader or
leaders.

You can optionally specify the leaders to follow using a bunch of
"_leader particles_": either a [group|groups] within the input
stream (set with the __Leader group__ parameter) or the particles from a
second input stream (connect a particle stream to the node's second
input).

The "leader" can be a computed point based on the leader particles (the
spatial center of the leader particles, the center of mass, the
center of density, or individual particles).

Each particle in the leader stream can lead individual particles from
the follower stream. Houdini can automatically assign followers to
leaders, or you can set a `follow` attribute on particles to determine
which leader they will follow. Use the [Icon:POP/property][Property POP|Node:pop/property]
to set the follow-related attributes on particles.

== How to use Follow ==

    # Start with two particle streams.
    
    # Use the [Icon:POP/group][group|Node:pop/group] node to put one particle stream into a group called `leaders`. Use another group node to put the other stream into a group called `followers`. 
        
    # Use a [Icon:POP/collect][collect|Node:pop/collect] node to collect the two particle streams.

    # Click the [Icon:POP/follow][Follow|Node:pop/follow] button on the __Drive Particles__ tab of the shelf.
    
        On the __Leader__ tab, set the __Leader Group__ to `leaders`.
            
    NOTE:
        You must customized the parameters of the particle and follow nodes in the parameter editor. This tool is quite advanced and simply putting down the nodes will not automatically generate the desired result.
