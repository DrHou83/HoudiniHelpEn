= Orbit a center point =

The [Icon:POP/orbit][Orbit POP|Node:pop/orbit] makes particles orbit a center or centers.

You can optionally specify the leaders to follow using a bunch of
"_center particles_": either a [Icon:POP/group][group|groups]  within the input
stream (set with the __Center group__ parameter) or the particles from a
second input stream (connect a particle stream to the node's second
input).

You can specify the orbit axis, radius, and revolution speed for all
particles, or control each with per-particle attributes.

== Using the Orbit tool ==

    # Click the [Icon:POP/orbit][Orbit|Node:pop/orbit] button on the __Drive Particles__ tab of the shelf.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # By default, the node looks for axis, radius, and speed attributes on the input particles. To specify values for these parameters manually, turn on the corresponding override checkbox on the __Orbit__ tab and set the parameter (The orbit speed is set in RPM).

    # On the __Center__ tab, use the __Center type__ parameter to choose the center point the particles should orbit.

TIP:
    Reduce the __Scale__ parameter on the __Orbit__ tab below 1 to get
    smoother transitions into orbit. When the scale is high, the node
    pushes the input particles from their current location into orbit
    almost instantly. Reducing the scale reduces the effect of the orbit
    node on particles, reducing the speed at which the particles move
    into their orbits, creating smoother motion.

    However, scale is relative to the spatial size of the orbit - a larger orbit probably means you want a higher transition speed. If you set the scale too low, the node may not be able to apply enough force to move the particles into proper orbits at all.

TIP:
    Animate or control the radius, axis, and/or speed parameters with
    [expressions|/expressions] to create interesting effects beyond a simple ring of orbiting particles.

TIP:
    To have each particle orbit in a different direction, creating a
    "swarming globe" effect, use expressions to set the axis components
    to random values with the particle ID as the seed:

    {{{
    #!exp
    rand($ID + 1.0001)
    }}}
