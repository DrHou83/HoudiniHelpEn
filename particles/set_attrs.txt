= Manually setting attributes =

The particle operators on the __Attributes__ tab allow you to set different types of attributes on the particle system. You can also set or create arbitrary attributes to particles using the [Icon:POP/attribute][Attribute
POP|Node:pop/attribute]. This lets you store custom per-particle
information relevant to your simulation you can use later in
expressions.

== Directly set motion attributes ==

A more low-level way to affect particle motion than applying
[forces|forces]  is to set the position and/or motion (velocity,
acceleration) attributes of particles directly.

NOTE:
    The default rules that normally control the motion of particles based on their attributes will _also_ be applied unless you turn them off with the [Suppress Rule
    POP|Node:pop/suppress].

TIP:
    You can also set any arbitrary attribute, including the attributes set indirectly by the operators listed above, using the [Icon:POP/attribute][Attribute POP|Node:pop/attribute]. Refer to the [POP
    locals|Node:pop/popLocals] page to see the "standard" attributes you can set.
