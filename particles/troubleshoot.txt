== A node I added to the network seems to have no effect==
    
Possible causes and solutions:
          
* The [cook flag|/nodes/pop] is on a node higher up or on a different branch of the network. 

    To fix this simply set the cook flag on or after the node whose effect you want to see in the viewer.

* The node's __Activation__ parameter is (or evaluates to) 0.

    Check the value of the node's __Activation__ parameter. If it is an expression, make sure it evaluates to a value other than 0.

== Particles escape my Collision POP==
    
The movement of the particles is larger than the distance within which Houdini can detect collisions, so the particles move right through the "wall".
    
Possible solutions:

* If you are trying to keep particles inside geometry that is moving or rotating, remember to set __Hint__ on the __Collision__ tab to Translating Geometry.
      
* Increase the __Collision tolerance__. This makes the particle look farther away to see if it has "hit" something.
      
* On the __Behavior__ tab, increase the __Oversampling__. This makes the simulation move the particles in finer-grained steps, which increases the likelihood of detecting a hit.
