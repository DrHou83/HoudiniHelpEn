= Using geometry =

Many operators let you choose geometry to interact with. For example, in the [Icon:POP/collision][Collision POP|Node:pop/collision], you choose geometry that particles can collide with.

There are two ways to reference geometry operators (SOPs) in particle operators:

* Create an object and then click the [Icon:POP/source][Source from Geometry|/nodes/pop/source] button on the __Create Particles__ tab of the shelf. The particle system will attach itself to the object you have selected.

* In the [Icon:POP/source][Source|/nodes/pop/source] particle node, set __Geometry Source__ to Use Parameter Values. In the __SOP__ field, enter the path to a geometry (SOP) node.

Using the [shelf|/shelf] is usually more convenient and flexible since you do not have to enter explicit paths and you can switch the geometry input easily.

TIP:
    Turn on the [Icon:NODEFLAGS/template] [template flag|/nodes/POP/_index] on a particle node that references geometry to [see the referenced geometry as a guide|visualize].
