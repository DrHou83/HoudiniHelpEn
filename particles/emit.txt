= Emitting =

There are two main way to create particles: from geometry or from a point in space. There are tools on the __Create Particles__ tab of the [shelf|/shelf] that let you create particle systems by clicking the buttons. Clicking the [Icon:POP/location][Emitter|/shelf/emitfromlocation] button will allow you to select a point in space from which to emit particles, and the [Icon:POP/source][Source from Geometry|/shelf/emitfromgeometry] button will allow you to choose a geometry object from which to emit particles.

In addition to these common ways to create particles, you can also
[Icon:POP/split][split|/shelf/split] new particles off from existing particles, and emit new particles from the point where two or more particle streams cross with the [Stream POP|Node:pop/stream].

TIP:
    You can add particle-related attributes to geometry using the [Icon:SOP/point][Point
    SOP|Node:sop/point], and the particles will inherit the attributes
    as they are born. This lets you define particle attributes in
    relation to geometry attributes.
