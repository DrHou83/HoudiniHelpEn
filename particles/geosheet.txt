= Inspecting attributes =

Use the [details pane|/ref/panes/geosheet] to show the values
of the attributes on particles in a particle system.

steps>>
    # Choose __Windows > Floating Pane__ to create a new window, then press ((Alt + 8)).

      Alternatively, you can simply change an existing pane into a
      details pane by pressing ((Alt + 8)).

    # Navigate to the [Icon:SOP/particle][POP network|/nodes/sop/popnet].

    # Make sure the spreadsheet is set to show attributes for Points (use the drop-down menu).

      The spreadsheet should show one row for each particle in the
      system, with columns for each attribute.

== Reading the `pstate` attribute ==

The `pstate` attribute is actually a "bit field", storing several different state flags in a single value. Houdini calculates the value of `pstate` by adding up the following values for each flag that is on:

table>>
    tr>>
        th>>Flag
        th>>Value
    tr>>
        td>>Primary
        td>>1
    tr>>
        td>>Dying
        td>>2
    tr>>
        td>>Stopped
        td>>4
    tr>>
        td>>Collided
        td>>8
    tr>>
        td>>Stuck
        td>>16
    tr>>
        td>>Sliding
        td>>32768

In addition, the `pstate` indicates the state of rule suppression.

table>>
    tr>>
        th>>Flag
        th>>Value
    tr>>
        td>>Suppress all
        td>>32512
    tr>>
        td>>Suppress position
        td>>256
    tr>>
        td>>Suppress velocity
        td>>512
    tr>>
        td>>Suppress up
        td>>1024
    tr>>
        td>>Suppress age
        td>>2048
    tr>>
        td>>Suppress reap
        td>>4096
    tr>>
        td>>Suppress rotate
        td>>8192
    tr>>
        td>>Suppress angular velocity
        td>>16384

One way to check if a certain "bit" is on in the `pstate` value is to open a Python shell and use the `&` operator.

{{{
#!pycon

>>> # For example, if the pstate is 27
>>> # Dying?
>>> bool(27 & 2)
True
>>> # Stopped?
>>> bool(27 & 4)
False
>>> # Stuck?
>>> bool(27 & 16)
True
}}}

In expressions you would use individual local variables such as `$STOPPED` instead of reading `pstate`.
