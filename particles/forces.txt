= Applying forces =

You can direct particle motion with _forces_. Forces can emanate from
[geometry|/model/create] in the scene (for example, you can create a [sphere|/shelf/sphere] and have it attract or repel particles), or you can create a general directional force (such as gravity).

NOTE:
    Forces can be scaled and modified by attributes such as mass,
    charge, and drag.

== How to direct particle motion with forces ==
    
:task:Make geometry attract or repel particles:
    # Click the [Icon:POP/attractor][Attractor|Node:pop/attractor] button from the __Drive Particles__ tab of the shelf.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the particle system you want to be attracted or repelled and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the object you want the particles to be attracted to or repelled from and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    The degree of attraction/repulsion can be modified in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

    For specific parameter help see the [Icon:POP/attractor][Attractor|Node:pop/attractor] node help.

:task:Create a general directional force:
    # Click the [Icon:POP/force][Force|Node:pop/force] button on the __Drive Particles__ tab of the shelf.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # Specify the node settings in the operation controls toolbar or [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
    
    You must specify the amount of force and direction of force in the operation controls toolbar or [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

    NOTE:
        You can also use the [Icon:POP/fan][Fan|/shelf/fan] or [Icon:POP/wind][Wind|/shelf/wind] tools on the [shelf|/shelf] depending on how you want the particles to react to the directional force.
    
:task:Make the particles affected by gravity:
        
    # Click the [Icon:POP/gravity][Gravity|Node:pop/force] button on the __Drive Particles__ tab.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # Specify the node settings in the operation controls toolbar or [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

    NOTE:
        The Gravity POP is simply predefined force node whose force and direction can be altered in the parameter editor.
    
:task:Add random force to particles:
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/noise][Noise|Node:pop/force] button on the __Drive Particles__ tab.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

== Mass, drag, and charge == (props)

The mass and charge attributes change how some POPs interact with a
particle. You can set the mass and/or charge of particles with the
[Icon:POP/property][Property POP|Node:pop/property].

Drag is a resistance against a particle's velocity. The resistance is
proportional to the particle's speed and the value of its `drag`
attribute, which represents the particle's _drag coefficient_, or how
"un-aerodynamic" the particle is. So faster particles and particles with
high drag coefficient have their speed retarded more by drag. You can
set the drag of particles with the [Icon:POP/drag][Drag POP|Node:pop/drag].

Changing the mass of a particle scales forces on the particle according
to the following formula:

F = M x A

...where <<F>> is force, <<M>> is mass, and <<A>> is acceleration. So,
particles with high mass require more force (<<F>>) to change their
motion.

The most obvious application of the charge attribute is in the [Icon:POP/interact][Interact POP|Node:pop/interact], where like subatomic particles, particles with like charges repel while particles with opposite charges attract.

Some operators use the charge to multiply the computed force. So if the resulting force is positive, the force will act in its intended direction. If the resulting force is negative, the force will act in the opposite direction.

For example, the [Icon:POP/attractor][Attractor POP|Node:pop/attractor] creates a force that attracts the particle to the attractor. A positive force will move the particle towards the attractor. If the particle has a negative charge, however, the positive force multiplied by the negative charge would result in a negative force that would repel the particle away from the attractor.

Operators that use the mass and charge attributes, such as Attractor,
will often have __Ignore mass__ and __Ignore charge__ options to prevent
the attributes from affecting the normal operation of the node.
