= Flow of particle data through the network =

:task:Control which node's output appears in the viewport:
    * Turn on the [cook flag|/nodes/pop] on the node whose output should appear in the viewport. Nodes after the "cook node" in the flow will not affect the display.

:task:Merge two or more streams in the same network level:
    # Create two or more [Icon:SOP/particle][particle systems|/particles].
        
    # Create a [Icon:POP/collect][Collect node|Node:pop/collect] and connect the streams to its inputs.

:task:Switch between two or more streams:
    # Create two or more [Icon:SOP/particle][particle systems|/particles].
        
    # Create a [Icon:COMMON/switch][Switch node|Node:pop/switch] and connect the streams to its inputs.

    # Use an [expression|/expressions] in or animate or the __Select input__
      parameter to choose which input to pass through to the node's output.

:task:Switch a node on or off as part of the simulation:
    * Use an [expression|/expressions] in or animate the node's __Activation__
      parameter. A value of `0` means the node is off, any other value means the node is on.

      To turn a node off temporarily while editing the network (not as part of the animation or simulation itself), use the node's [bypass flag|/nodes/pop].

:task:Import particle streams from other parts of the scene network:
    # Create a [Icon:POP/fetch][Fetch node|Node:pop/fetch].

    # Set the __Number of POPs__ parameter to the number of streams you need to import from elsewhere.

    # Set the __Pop #__ fields to the paths to the particle
      operators whose output you want to fetch.

:task:Operate on a subset of a particle stream:
    * See  [particle groups|groups].
