= Attracting or repel particles =

The [Icon:POP/interact][Interact POP|Node:pop/interact] makes particles attract or repel each other according to their charge (opposites charges attract and like charges repel), like subatomic particles.

== How to make particles attract or repel each other ==

# Create a [particle system|/particles].
    For information on how to create a particle system see the [Icon:POP/source][Emit Particles|emit] help.

# Use the [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu] to create a [Icon:POP/property][Property|Node:pop/property] node, and set the __Charge__ attribute of the particles on the __Misc__ tab using an [expression|/expressions].

    NOTE:
        You can also use the Interact POP's override charge option on the __Defaults__ tab to set the charge for each particle directly in the Interact POP.

# Use the [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu] to create an  [Icon:POP/interact][Interact|Node:pop/interact] node and [connect|/ref/panes/network] the particle stream to it.

See the [Icon:POP/interact][Interact|Node:pop/interact] node help for specific parameter details.

TIP:
    To visualize the charges on each particle, insert a [Icon:POP/color][Color node|Node:pop/color]. In the color node's parameters, click __Parm__ and set the color components to `-$CHARGE, 0, $CHARGE`. This will color the positively charged particles blue and the negatively charged particles red.
