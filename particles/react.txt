= Reacting to surfaces =

The [Icon:POP/collision][Collision POP|Node:pop/collision] lets you specify how the particles will react once they collide with the surface. You can make them die, bounce, stop, stick, or slide on collision, as well as continue on course.

The [Icon:POP/creep][Creep POP|Node:pop/creep] lets you manually stick particles to a surface at explicit UV coordinates as well as slide them along the surface. 

The [Icon:POP/limit][Limit POP|Node:pop/limit] is very similar to the Collision POP, but instead of detecting collisions with geometry, it detects particles "colliding" with an imaginary boundary, either a box or a sphere.

The [Icon:POP/softlimit][Soft Limit POP|Node:pop/limit] is like the Limit POP, but gives softer bounces.

== Using Collision == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:POP/collision][Collision|Node:pop/collision] button on the __Drive Particles__ tab of the shelf.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the object you want the particles to affect and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # Choose how the particles will react in the __Behavior__ drop-down menu on the __Behavior__ tab of the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
