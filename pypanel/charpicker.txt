== Starting a new rig setup ==

:task:Create a new setup:
    Add a character rig to the scene by selecting that character with [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_node]. Alternatively, the node name can be typed into the character text field, or dragged in from the Network Editor. A history of the selected characters is maintained in the drop down menu next to the character text field.
        
:task:Add a new view:
    Use the __Tabs > Add tab__ menu and select either __Single View__ or __Multi View Tab__. A __Single View__ will contain one character viewer pane, while a __Multi View__ will contain four panes that can be resized.
        
    NOTE:
        Once the pane is created, a tab will appear, and __Edit__ will be toggled on. While __Edit__ is active, you can add control buttons, set background images, create and delete groups, and resize the view. To resume normal functionality, turn off __Edit__.  

== Setting up control buttons ==

:task: Add a new control button:
    Click __Add Control__ in the current view when __Edit__ is turned on.
    
:task: Reposition the control button:
    Click ((RMB)) and drag the control.
    
:task: Display a menu of options to set for the control:
    Click ((LMB)) when __Edit__ is turned on.

:task: Link the button to a control:
    Open the menu and click __Edit Target Nodes__. All of the controls for the current character will be shown and you can pick one or more of them. 

:task: Select/deselect controls:
    When __Edit__ is off, select the control(s) by clicking ((LMB)) the control. You can add to the selection by holding ((Shift)) and clicking additional buttons, or remove a button from the selection by holding ((Ctrl)). 

:task: Select all controls at once:
    Hold ((Shift)) and click ((LMB)) the background.
    
:task: Select mirrored control buttons:
    Hold ((Shift + Alt)) and click ((LMB)) when __Edit__ is turned on.
    
    NOTE:
        To be mirror button pairs, the buttons must have the same node contents. This means the nodes they contain can only differ in name by the suffixes `left` and `right`, and the number of nodes they contain must be the same.


If another control button shares any nodes with the button that is currently selected, it will be also be highlighted, but not selected.

== Adding background images ==

While in __Edit__, you can set the background image of the view 
by clicking __Set Background__, and set the image using the currently opened viewport, 
an external file, or an image supplied by a URL link. The images will be saved within 
the character picker, so there is no need to keep image files or maintain directory continuity.

NOTE:
    A __Scene View__ tab must be visible for the background to be set with a viewport image. Additionally, the .hip must be saved and have an associated `$HIP` directory.

== Manipulating multiple characters in a scene ==

If you have multiple characters in the scene with identical rigs and wish to use the same layout controls to manipulate both, select the other characters using the [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_node] chooser. You can toggle between the characters using the dropdown menu. Whichever character is displayed in the __Characters__ field is the character the controls will be applied to.

== Loading and Saving ==

Views can be saved to a `.json` file or directly to the rig's digital asset. For example, the [Simple Biped|Node:obj/simplebiped] character already includes a character picker rig. The view state is stored by using the __File > Save Layout__ menu. Views can be loaded from a digital asset or an external file via __File > Load Layout__. 

TIP:
    Click ((Ctrl + S)) to quick save changes to the place the layout was last saved or originally loaded from.
