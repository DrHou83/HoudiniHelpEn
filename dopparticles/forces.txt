= Applying forces =

You can direct particle motion with forces. Forces can emanate from
[geometry|/model/create] in the scene (for example, you can create a [sphere|/shelf/sphere] and have it attract or repel particles), or you can create a general directional force (such as gravity).


== How to direct particle motion with forces ==
    
:task:Make geometry attract or repel particles:
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/pointattract][Point Attract|/shelf/dynamics_popattract] or [Icon:SHELF/curveattract][Curve Attract|/shelf/dynamics_popattract] button from the __Particles__ tab of the shelf.
        
    # Select the particle system you want to be attracted or repelled and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # Select the object or curve you want the particles to be attracted to or repelled from and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    The degree of attraction/repulsion can be modified with the __Force Scale__ parameter on the __Force__ tab of the [Icon:POP/attractor][POP Attractor|Node:dop/popattract] node. A positive value will attract the particles and a negative value will repel the particles.

:task:Create a general directional force:
    # Click the [Icon:POP/force][Force Particles|/shelf/dynamics_popforce]  tool on the __Particles__ tab of the shelf.
        
    # Select the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # Set the __Force__ parameter on the [Icon:POP/force][POP Force|Node:dop/popforce] node to affect the particles. By default this is set to `-9.81` in the Y direction, to apply a gravity force.

    NOTE:
        You can also use the [Icon:POP/fan][Fan Particles|/shelf/dynamics_popfan] or [Icon:POP/wind][Wind on Particles|/shelf/dynamics_popwind] tools on the [shelf|/shelf], depending on how you want the particles to react to the directional force.
    
:task:Add random force to particles:
    # Click the [Icon:POP/force][Force Particles|/shelf/dynamics_popforce] tool on the __Particles__ tab of the shelf.
        
    # Select the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        
    # Modify the parameters on the __Noise__ tab of the [Icon:POP/force][POP Force|Node:dop/popforce] node. You can change the __Swirl Size__, __Pulse Length__, __Roughness__, __Turbulence__, etc,

:task:Move particles along, toward, or around a curve:

        # Create a curve using the [Icon:SOP/drawcurve][Draw Curve|/shelf/drawcurve] shelf tool.
        
        # Create a particle system along the curve using the [Icon:POP/location][Location|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] or [Icon:POP/source][Source|/shelf/dynamics_popsource] shelf tools.
        
        # Click the [Icon:DOP/vortexforce][Curve Force|Node:dop/popcurveforce] tool on the __Particles__ tab.
        
        # Select the curve you want to affect your [particles|/dopparticles] and press ((Enter)).
        
        [Image:/images/shelf/POPcurveforce.png]
        
:task:Make particles flock together:

        # Create a particle system along the curve using the [Icon:POP/location][Location|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] or [Icon:POP/source][Source|/shelf/dynamics_popsource] shelf tools.
        
        # Click the [Icon:POP/follow][Flock|Node:dop/popflock] tool on the __Particles__ tab.
        
                You can choose the __Number of Centers__ on the [Icon:POP/follow][POP Flock|Node:dop/popflock] node to determine how many different clusters of particles are formed. You can also the modify the parameters on the  __Interaction Force__ tab to control how much they stay together and how far apart they can get.

        TIP:
                To create more realistic simulations, do not continuously birth particles. You can also add some noise with a [Icon:POP/force][POP Force|Node:dop/popforce] node for a more natural look.
        
        NOTE:
                To move the flocks, you can use a [Icon:POP/attractor][POP Attract|Node:dop/popattract] node to have them follow an object (such as a character), or use other [Icon:POP/force][POP Forces|Node:dop/popforce] to direct them.
