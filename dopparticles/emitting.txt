= Emitting =

There are two main way to create particles: from geometry or from a point in space. There are tools on the __Particles__ tab of the [shelf|/shelf/] that let you create particle systems. Clicking the [Icon:POP/location][Location|Node:dop/poplocation] button will allow you to select a point in space from which to emit particles, and the [Icon:POP/source][Source|Node:dop/popsource] button will allow you to choose a geometry object from which to emit particles.

In addition to these common ways to create particles, you can also create new particles from existing particles using the [Icon:POP/split][Replicate|/shelf/dynamics_popreplicate] tool.

For more information on how to emit particles, see the following help pages:

[Icon:POP/fireworks] |
    [Fireworks|/shelf/dynamics_popfireworks] |
        Emits multi-colored particles from a point, which simulates fireworks.

[Icon:POP/location] |
    [Location|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] |
        Emits particles from a point in all directions.

[Icon:POP/source] |
    [Source|/shelf/dynamics_popsource] |
        Emits particles from an object in all directions.

[Icon:POP/split] |
    [Replicate|/shelf/dynamics_popreplicate] |
        Generates particles from incoming particles.
