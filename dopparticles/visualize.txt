= Visualizing Forces =

There are several ways to visualize forces in the viewport. The easiest way is to turn on the __Guide__ parameter on the [Icon:POP/force][POP Force|Node:dop/popforce]. This will display the direction and magnitude of the force. In the following example, there is a directional force of 2 in the X axis.

If you increase the force to 10, the size of the guides will increase.

This is especially useful for visualizing noise.

You can also turn on [Icon:VIEW/display_point_normals]__Display Point Trails__ in the __Display Options__ toolbar, which illustrates the direction the particles are moving, scaled by the timestep. The length of the guides show the actual time moved.

Additionally, you can create custom vector displays for forces in the [3D Display Options dialog|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d] by clicking the [Icon:VIEW/display_point_normals] __New vector display option__ button on the __Markers__ tab. Some useful [attributes|/dopparticles/attributes] for POPs are `force` and `targetv` (for [POP Wind|Node:dop/popwind]). To turn on visualization in the viewport, simply choose it from the [Icon:VIEW/display_point_attribute]__Display custom attributes__ dropdown menu in the __Display Options__ toolbar.
