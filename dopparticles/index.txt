"""How to create particle simulations."""

Particles are extremely useful for realistically modeling phenomena such as flocking, smoke, fire, and dust. 

Particles in the dynamics environment is more useful than the old way of using POPs, because they are multi-threaded and memory efficient. They also provide more artist control, since they are built out of VOPs. Additionally, having POPs in the Dynamics network results in fewer network transitions and a more centralized workflow.
