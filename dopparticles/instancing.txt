== Instance geometry on particles ==

:task:Instance geometry on particles:
        # Select the [Icon:SOP/particle][particle system|/dopparticles/] you want to be affected.
        
        # Click the [Icon:POP/instance][Instance|Node:dop/popinstance] tool on the __Particles__ tab.
        
        # Select the object you want the particles to be replaced with and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

        For specific parameter help see the [Icon:POP/instance][Instance|Node:dop/popinstance] node help.

:task:Rotate the instanced geometry using torque:

        # Insert a  [Icon:POP/torque][POP Torque|Node:dop/poptorque] node into your chain.

                Torque is like sticking a handle on something and rotating it by pushing on the handle.

        # Set the desired __Axis__ to spin the particle around, and the __Amount__ of speed.
        
:task:Make the instanced geometry look at an object:
        # Insert a [Icon:POP/lookat][POP Look At|Node:dop/poplookat] node into your chain.

        # Set the __ Mode__ to __Target is Point__.      
        
        # Set the __Reference Object__ for the particles to look at.

                NOTE:
                        If no reference object is used, the particles will look at 0, 0, 0. You can modify the __Target__ parameter to change its location.

:task:Make the instanced geometry look at a plane:
        # Insert a [Icon:POP/lookat][POP Look At|Node:dop/poplookat] node into your chain.

        # Set the __ Mode__ to __Target is Direction__. 

        # Set the __Target__ parameter to where you want the particle to reorient to face.

== Rendering Instanced Geometry ==(render)

When you create a particle system, Houdini also creates a renderable object at the object level. For example, if you create a particle system with the [Icon:POP/location][Location Particles|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] shelf tool, your renderable object will be called `location_particles`.

In order to render instanced geometry, you must append an [Instance SOP|Node:sop/instance] after the [DOP I/O|Node:sop/dopio] node inside the renderable object.

== Motion blur ==

When calculating motion blur, Mantra by default assumes the geometry of an object is unchanging, and blurs it as a whole. For a particle system obviously the points are moving, so you need to turn on _velocity blur_ to use the velocity (`v`) attribute of the points to blur them individually.

So, to enable motion blur on particles you must enable it on the _object_ as well the _render node_.

:task:Enable velocity blur on an object:
    # Select the object containing the particles.
    
    # In the [parameter editor|/network/parms], click the __Render__ tab, then the __Sampling__ sub-tab.
    
    Turn on __Geometry velocity blur__.

:task:Enable motion blur on a render node:
    # In the main menu open __Render > Edit Render Node__ and choose the render node.
    
        If you don't already have a render node, you can create one by choosing __Render > Create Render Node > Mantra__.
    
    # In the [parameter editor|/network/parms], click the __Properties__ tab and then the __Sampling__ sub-tab.
    
    # Turn on __Allow motion blur__.
