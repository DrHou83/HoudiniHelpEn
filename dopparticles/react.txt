= Reacting to surfaces =

The default behavior for particles that hit a [Icon:DOP/staticobject][Static Object|Node:dop/staticobject] is to bounce off. If you want them to react in another way, you can use the [Icon:POP/collision][POP Collision Detect|Node:dop/popcollisiondetect].

TIP:
        If you are colliding particles with a [Icon:SOP/grid][Grid|Node:sop/grid], turn off __Use Volume Based Collision Detection__ on the [Icon:DOP/staticobject][Static Object|Node:dop/staticobject] node.

The [Icon:POP/limit][POP Limit|Node:dop/poplimit] is very similar to the Collision POP, but instead of detecting collisions with geometry, it detects particles "colliding" with an imaginary boundary within a cube in 3d space.  This is useful to automatically cull or bounce particles that fly too far.

The [Icon:POP/softlimit][POP Soft Limit|Node:dop/popsoftlimit] is like the Limit POP, but gives softer bounces. It slows particles down when they hit the boundary, giving a less jerky response than a limit or collision.

TIP:
        You can use a [Icon:POP/property][POP Property|Node:dop/popproperty] node to add randomization to the __Mass__ and __Bounce__ so that particles don't all bounce to the same height.

NOTE:
        Standard POP collision modes support the `hittotal` attribute that tracks the cumulative number of hits. See the [Attributes page|/dopparticles/attributes] for a full list of Collision attributes.
