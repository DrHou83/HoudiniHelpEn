= Limiting particle speed =

There are three ways to control speed of particles. You can use [Icon:POP/drag][Drag|Node:dop/popdrag], [Icon:POP/speedlimit][Speed Limit|Node:dop/popspeedlimit], or [Icon:POP/wind][Wind|Node:dop/popwind].

:task:Apply [drag|Node:dop/popdrag] to particles:
       
    # Click the [Icon:POP/drag][Drag Particles|Node:dop/popdrag] button on the __Particles__ shelf tab.
        
    # Select the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

:task:Set a high and low limit on the speed of particles:
        
    # Create a [Icon:POP/speedlimit][Speed Limit|Node:pop/speedlimit] node in the particle network.

    # Use the __Minimum Speed__ and __Maximum Speed__ parameters, to set the velocities. Each particle can have its own set of imposed limits. 


:task:Push particles up to, but not past, a certain speed:
    
    # Click the [Icon:POP/wind][Wind on Particles|Node:dop/popwind] button on the __Particles__ shelf tab.
            
    # Select the particle system you want to be affected and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
            
        The Wind POP simulates a pushing force like wind, that can increase the velocity of particles but not past its own speed.

    # Set the __Wind Velocity__ to control the direction and magnitude of the wind, and the __Air Resistance__ to control the intensity of the wind.
