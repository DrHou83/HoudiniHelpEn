:task: Create a particle system:
    * You can either use the [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu] in a [geometry object|Node:obj/geo], or by use the tools on the __Particles__ shelf. See [Emitting|/dopparticles/emitting] for more information.

:task: View the simulation:
    * Make sure the [display flag|/nodes/dop/] is turn on the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver] or a node after it in the network. 
    
:task: Disable POP nodes you don't want to affect your simulation:
    * You can't just move the [display flag|/nodes/dop/] like in old POPs. You must either remove it from the chain, or turn on the [bypass flag|/nodes/dop/]. The [display flag|/nodes/dop/] must always be on the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver] or a node after it in the network. 
    
:task: Allow other DOPs to affect POPs:
    * Verify the __External Forces__ parameter on the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver] is turned on.  It should be on by default.

:task: Merge two or more streams:
    * Use a [Merge node|Node:dop/merge] before the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver].

:task: Switch a node on or off as part of the simulation:
    * Turn on the yellow [Bypass flag|/nodes/dop/] for the node you want to exclude from the simulation.
