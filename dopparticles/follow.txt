= Following a leader or leaders =

Making particles follow leader particles can be set up using a [Icon:POP/attractor][POP Attract|Node:dop/popattract] node. 

== Making particles follow other particles ==

To make particles follow other particles, add a [Icon:POP/attractor][POP Attract|Node:dop/popattract] node to the `followers` stream of particles and set the __Attraction Type__ to __Particles__. Next, choose the  particle [stream|/dopparticles/streams] you want them to follow (stream name of the leader particles) in the  __Point Group__ parameter. In the following example, this is `stream_leaders`.

You can then set the __Force Method__ to either __Accelerate__ or __Follow__. If you choose __Accelerate__, a general force is applied in the direction of the leader particles. If you choose __Follow__, the velocity of the next frame is used and the speed is set to match the leader's.

TIP:
        You may get better results by turning on __Predict Intercept__ when using __Follow__. This will prevent particles from charging towards the moving particles and potentially overshooting them. Instead, the follower particles will anticipate the leaders' direction on the next frame, and try to head them off.

== Changing the way followers behave ==

Another important parameter to consider is __Match Method__. This will change the way the follower particles behave. In the following example, there are 5 leaders. Setting __Match Method__ to __Average Position__ will take the average position of the 5 leaders to create a target.

If __Match Method__ is set to __Point Per Particle__, the followers will separate into trails, with one fifth of the followers following each individual particle.

To create a more swarm-like effect, add a [Icon:POP/force][POP Force|Node:dop/popforce] with some noise in your `followers` stream.

== Make particles follow an object ==
        
You can make particles follow an animated object the same way, by setting the __Attraction Type__ to __Surface Points__ and the __SOP Path__ to your geometry object.
