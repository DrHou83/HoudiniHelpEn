"""Creates spare properties from a set of pre-defined properties"""

:usage: `opproperty -R [-q]`
:usage: `opproperty -l [<<pattern>> [<<category>>]]`
:usage: `opproperty [-f] [-e] [-C <<folder>>] [-F <<folder>>] node pattern properties`

@options

`-R`:
    Reload all property definitions.  The -q option makes this
    operation perform "quietly" (without reporting success)
    
`-l`:
    List information about pre-defined properties.
    
    - With no arguments, the command lists all top level categories.

    - When you specify a pattern, the command prints the parameters
      for all matching top level categories.

    - When you specify a category along with a pattern, the command
      prints only parameters for that category.
      
`-f`:
    (Force) Bypass the filtering check when adding properties.

    Properties have a filter associated with them.  This filter
    indicates to which Houdini node types the properties should be added.
    With the -f option, properties may be added to any node.
    
`-F`:
    Specify the folder to which the properties should be installed.
    Usually properties will be installed in the top-level folders of
    nodes.  This option allows the properties to be installed as a
    sub-folder of an existing folder.

`-C`:
    Normally spare properties have a category setting which specifies the
    sub-folder where the parameter should be installed.   The `-C` option
    overrides this category setting.

    This name is different than the `-F` option in that the `-F` option
    specifies the parent folder which should contain the sub-folder, while the
    `-C` command specifies the name of the sub-folder itself.  If the names are
    the same, the parameter will be installed in the parent folder directly.

@examples

{{{
opproperty -l mantra*
}}}

Lists all properties associated with the top level mantra categories.

{{{
opproperty -f -F Render /obj/model mantra* *shading*
}}}

Installs all the parameters defined for `mantra` that contain
`shading` in their name.  Since the parameters are intended to be
added to Property SHOPs, the -f option allows addition to the geometry
object.  The -F option states that the properties should be installed
in the `Render` folder of the object's parameters.

{{{
opproperty -f -C Lighting -F Render /obj/model mantra* *shading*
}}}

Installs all the parameters defined for `mantra` that contain
`shading` in their name.  This will install the parameters in the "Render"
folder in a sub-folder labelled "Lighting".
