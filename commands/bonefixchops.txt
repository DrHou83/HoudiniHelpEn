= bonefixchops =

"""Cleans up any references to a bone in InverseKin CHOPs before you
delete the bone."""

:usage: `bonefixchops [-r] <<boneObject>> `

If an InverseKin CHOP is using an Inverse Kinematics solver on a bone
chain from bone1 to bone4, and you execute "bonefixchops bone4", this
CHOP will be changed to apply its solver to the chain from bone1 to
bone3. If you have an InverseKin CHOP that is using an Inverse
Kinematics solver on bone1 only, and you execute "bonefixchops bone1",
the CHOP will be deleted.

This command is used in the default delete script of bone objects.

@options
    `-r`:
        Recursively deletes all outputs of the found InverseKin CHOPs
        as well.
