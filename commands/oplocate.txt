= oplocate =

"""Gets/sets the X/Y coordinates of operator tiles in the network
view."""

:usage: `oplocate [-d] [-x <<xval>>] [-y <<yval>>] <<operator_pattern>> `

If you don't give -x or -y, the command prints the operator's current
position.

The coordinates are absolute coordinates in the network view, they are
not affected by zooming or panning.



@options
    `-x`:
        Sets the X position of the operator(s).
    `-y`:
        Sets the Y position of the operator(s).
    `-d`:
        Makes -x and -y be relative (delta) to the operator's current
        position.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    oplocate -x 100 -y 200 geo1
    }}}
    Sets the position of geo1's tile to (100, 200) in the network view.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    oplocate -x 100 geo*
    }}}
    Position the tiles of all operators matching geo* horizontally at
    x=100.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    oplocate -d -x 10 -y 20 geo*
    }}}
    Move the tiles of all operators matching geo* by (+10, +20).
