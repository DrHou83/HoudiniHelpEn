"""Sets the contents of a network box."""

:usage: `nbop [-i] [-s] <<networkbox_name>> <<set|add|remove>> <<node_name_pattern>> `

Use this command to set the contents of a network box, or to add or
remove items from a network box.

@options
    `set <<node_name_pattern>> `:
        Sets the contents of the network box to be the nodes whose names
        match 'node_name_pattern'.
    `add <<node_name_pattern>> `:
        Adds nodes matching the given patterns to the network box.
    `remove <<node_name_pattern>> `:
        Removes nodes matching the given patterns from the network box.
    `-i`:
        Specifies that node_name_pattern should be a number. In this
        case the "indirect inputs"s of the given numbers will be
        considered for the requested operation. Use this to get at the
        inputs from within a subnet OP.
    `-s`:
        Snaps the borders of the network box to a snug fit around the
        network box's new contents.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    nbop netbox1 set light*
    }}}
    Set the contents of the box to be all nodes beginning with the
    string "light".

    {{{
    #!hscript
    nbop -i netbox1 add 1 2 3
    }}}
    Add the first, second, and third "indirect input"s in the subnet OP
    to the box

    {{{
    #!hscript
    nbop netbox1 remove li* ^light*
    }}}
    Remove all nodes from box1 that start with the string "li", with the
    exception of any nodes that start with "light"
