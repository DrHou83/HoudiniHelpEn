:usage: `iprview [-t <<timeout>>] [-T <<prefix>>] [-l 0|1] [-d <<desktop_name>>] <<pane1>> ...`

The [interactive render pane|/ref/views/ipr]  quickly
and automatically renders the scene as you work. This command lets you
set various options of an existing interactive render pane. Use the
[pane|Cmd:pane] command to create an interactive render pane.

@options
    `-t <<timeout>> `:
        The timeout (in seconds) between changes you make and an
        automatic re-render. Changes made within the timeout are
        "batched" into the next re-render. Default is 0.5.
    `-T <<prefix>> `:
        Houdini adds a number to the end of this string to create a name
        when you create a new take in the interactive render pane.
        Default is `ipr_`.
    `-l 0|1`:
        (lock) `-l 1` prevents the render from updating automatically.
        `-l 0` allows the render to update automatically.
