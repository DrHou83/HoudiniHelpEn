"""Autoplaces a node tile within a network."""

:usage: `opautoplace [-i] <<node_name>> `

This is useful for a node that was inserted manually into the center of
a network. Instead of moving all the nodes below it, you can call
opautoplace on that node to insert it nicely into the network.

This command maintains the structure of the rest of the network, simply
making room for the node(s) in the network. This differs from oplayout,
which replaces the current network layout completely.



@options
    `-i`:
        moves the inputs to accommodate the new node, rather than the
        outputs, which is the default behavior.
