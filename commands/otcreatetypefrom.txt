"""Creates a new operator type definition from a subnet."""

:usage: `otcreatetypefrom [-s] [-f] [-n <<op_name>>] [-N <<op_label>>] [-m <<min_inputs>>] [-M <<max_inputs>>] [-z] [-c <<comment>>] [-v <<version>>] [-l <<otl_file>>] [-i <<source>>] [-r <<rename_to>>] <<subnet>>`

This command serves the same purpose as the dialog that appears when you
choose the "Create Digital Asset" item from the RMB menu of a subnet
node tile. The various options correspond to the controls in the "Create
Digital Asset" dialog.

This command only works if the node specified by the <<subnet>> argument
is in fact a subnet node. You cannot use this command on custom subnet
operator types.

This command attempts to convert absolute paths to relative paths within
the subnet before creating the new type. If there are external
references the command signals an error and does not save. To override
this behavior, use -f to force a save. Note that references may have
been successfully modified even if an error occurs.

@options
    `-s`:
        Don't try to detect or fix external references.
    `-f`:
        Forces the save despite external references.
    `-n <<op_name>> `:
        Internal name for the new operator type. The default value is
        the name of the subnet node, preceded by the current user name
        to help ensure the name is unique.
    `-N <<op_label>> `:
        Descriptive name for the new operator type. The default value is
        derived from the name of the subnet.
    `-m <<min_inputs>> `:
        Minimum number of inputs. By default this is the number of
        inputs connected to the subnet node.
    `-M <<max_inputs>> `:
        Maximum number of inputs. By default this is the number of
        inputs connected to the subnet node.
    `-Z`:
        Specifies that the subnet contents should be stored in a
        compressed format to reduce disk space requirements.
    `-c <<comment>> `:
        Text comment for the operator type.
    `-v <<version>> `:
        Operator type version.
    `-l <<otl_file>> `:
        Name of the operator type library file where the new operator
        type should be saved. The default value is
        $HOME/houdini<<version>>/otls/OPcustom.otl.
    `-i <<source>> `:
        Location where the operator type library file should be
        installed. The default installs the library to the current hip
        file only. Valid values here are any entry in the HOUDINI_PATH.
    `-r <<rename_to>> `:
        Renames the subnet after creating the new operator type. The
        default is to not rename the subnet.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    otcreatetypefrom -n mysubnet -N "My Subnet" -m 0 -M 1 -l $HOME/mylib.otl -i $HOME/houdini<<version>> -r mysubnet1 /obj/subnet1
    }}}
    Creates a new operator type called mysubnet in $HOME/mylib.otl and
    installs it to $HOME/houdini<<version>>. The new operator type will
    take from 0-1 inputs. The node will be renamed to mysubnet1.
