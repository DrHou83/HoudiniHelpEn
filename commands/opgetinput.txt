"""Gets the node attached to a certain input of an operator."""

:usage: `opgetinput -n <<number>> <<input_op>> `
:usage: `opgetinput -o <<output_op>> [-u <<output_index>>] <<input_op>> `

opgetinput lets you inspect the inputs of an operator in two ways:

* Using the -n option, you can get the name of the node attached to a
  numbered input on the operator.

* Using the -o option, given two operators, you can get the input number
  on the first operator to which the second operator is attached.



@options
    `-n <<number>> `:
        Return the name of the node attached to input <<number>> of
        operator <<input_op>>. Returns an empty string if the input is
        not connected to anything.
    `-o <<output_op>> `:
        Return the number of the input of <<input_op>> that is connected
        to <<output_op>>.

        If <<output_op>> is not connected to <<input_op>>, the command
        returns -1. If <<output_op>> is connected to <<input_op>> more
        than once, the command returns the highest input number (unless
        you use -u).

    `-u <<output_index>> `:
        If you specify the -o option, you can use -u to test whether
        <<input_op>> is connected to <<output_op>> at the specific input
        number <<output_index>>. You can use -1 as the number to nullify
        this option.
