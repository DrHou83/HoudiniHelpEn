= otcomment =

"""Gets/sets the comment text associated with an operator type."""

:usage: `otcomment <<table>>/<<operator>> `
:usage: `otcomment -d <<table>>/<<operator>> `
:usage: `otcomment <<table>>/<<operator>> <<comment>> `

The <<table>> value specifies the class of the operator you want to
modify. A list of valid table names is found in the help for the otwrite
command. The <<operator>> value is the name of the specific operator
type.

The first usage of this command queries the comment for the specified
operator type.

The second usage clears the operator type comment.

The third usage sets the operator type comment.

NOTE:
    This command only works if the specified operator type is already
    defined using an operator type library.
