"""Aligns the capture and animation (deform) regions."""

:usage: `bonealigncapture [-b | -c] <<bone_objects>> `

Sets either capture or animation parameters of bones and their capture
regions.

The default usage (without `-c` parameter) will align the animation
(deform) region with the capture region. It will reset capture regions
of an animation bone setup to match that of a capture setup. It clears
any distortions of captured geometry (skin) caused by the change of bone
position or orientation.

This command is useful during a rigging process. After the geometry has
been captured any change in bone position is treated as animation.
However during the rigging process, joints are often shifted and
adjusted to improve animation. Changing a joint position will cause
deformation of the captured geometry, which is not desirable. To reset
any deformations of the geometry run this command on the bones whose
position or orientation has been modified.

@options

`-b`:
	Matches the bone transforms with the capture pose for aligning the
	animation with the capture pose. When there are no options specified,
	this command does the same alignment by modifying the __Rig Adjustment__
	parameters on the Capture Region nodes inside the bones instead.
	
`-c`:
    Sets the capture parameters of bones and their capture regions
    so the capture region is aligned with the current non-capture
    (animation or deform) location of the region. If this option is
    not specified, the command aligns the animation pose with
    capture pose.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    bonealigncapture /obj/bone1 /obj/bone2
    }}}
    Resets the distortion of the captured object after bone1 and bone2 have been moved.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    bonealigncapture /obj/bone_chain*
    }}}
    Resets the capture regions to the capture configuration (for the whole bone chain).

    {{{
    #!hscript
    bonealigncapture -c /obj/chain_bone*
    }}}
    Sets capture parameters of all bones in a chain to match their corresponding animation setup.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    bonealigncapture -c *bone*
    }}}
    Sets capture parameters on all bones (for example, to bring capture parameters up to date for old hip file in order to use new capture system).
