"""Saves operators to a file."""

:usage: `opwrite [-N] [-S] <<name1>> [<<name2>> ...] <<filename>> `

This is a partial motion file write. The contents are stored in .cpio
format. The file can be read back into networks of the same type using
the opread command.



@options
    `-N`:
        Save any network boxes that match the names provided, without
        automatically saving their contents.
    `-S`:
        Same as -N option, but also saves each specified network box's
        contents. Will avoid duplicate saving of an operator if both the
        operator and its network box are specified by the names
        provided.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opwrite geo* geometry.cpio
    }}}
    
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opwrite dome1 particle1 rainstorm.cpio
    }}}
    
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opwrite -S * everything.cpio
    }}}
