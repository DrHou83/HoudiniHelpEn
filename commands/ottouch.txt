= ottouch =

"""Sets the last modified time for an operator type definition."""

:usage: `ottouch <<table>>/<<operator>> <<hda_file>> [<<timestamp>>]`


The <<table>> value specifies the class of the operator you want to
modify. A list of valid table names is found in the help for the otwrite
command. The <<operator>> value is the name of the specific operator
type.

The <<hda_file>> argument specifies the operator type library to
modify.

If you do not give a <<timestamp>> value, the type is stamped with the
current time.

The time stamp must be in the format: "day mmm dd hh:mm:ss yyyy".
