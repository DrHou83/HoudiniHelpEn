"""Opens a property editor for an operator type."""

:usage: `otedit [-p [-x]] [-i] <<table>> <<operator>> <<[node]>>`

The <<table>> value specifies the class of the operator you want to
modify. A list of valid table names is found in the help for the otwrite
command. The <<operator>> value is the name of the specific operator
type. A node path can also be specified in the <<node>> value. This node
must be of the operator type being edited.



@options
    `-p`:
        Automatically promote any spare parameters on the <<node>>
        specified into parameters on the operator type.
    `-x`:
	When promoting spare parameters of the <<node>>, exclude any shader 
	parameters promoted by other mechanisms. This usually
	applies only to VOP nodes, where shading parameters are generated 
	by Parameter VOPs. Promoting such parameters with this command would
	conflict with the automatic promotion from VOP networks.
    `-i`:
        Immediately save the current state of the operator type, as if
        you clicked __Apply__ in the type properties editor.
