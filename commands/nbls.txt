"""List network boxes"""

:usage: `nbls [-R] [-a] [-l] [-t] [<<name_pattern>>]`

Lists the network boxes specified (or all the network boxes in the
current path). 'name_pattern' can be used to specify both network boxes
to list and networks or subnetworks to traverse within.



@options
    `-R`:
        Recurse through all networks and subnetworks
    `-a`:
        Consider all operators for traversal (including hidden ones)
    `-l`:
        Print in long format (show more information).

        The long format lists flags of the network box. A hyphen (-) is
        printed if the flag is not active.

        m:
            Minimized
        s:
            Selected
        If the network box contains items, the number of items it
        contains will be printed in parentheses.

    `-t`:
        Sort network boxes by their last modified time
