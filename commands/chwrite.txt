"""Writes channel data out to a .chan or .bchan file."""

:usage: `chwrite [-f <<fstart>> <<fend>>] <<channel_patterns>> <<chan_or_bchan_filename>>`
:usage: `chwrite <<channel_patterns>> <<chn_or_bchn_filename>>`

* If the filename ends in .chan or .bchan

  Writes out the specified channels as columns of raw values with one
  sample per frame across the given frame range.

  If no range is given the current global animation time range will be
  used. Channels will be output in columns in the order specified.

  The output will be saved as ascii data unless the file has a suffix of
  ".bchan", in which case binary format will be used. The order of
  channels resulting from a pattern match is not well defined.

* If the filename ends in .chn or .bchn

  Writes out the specified channels along with their full node paths
  into the specified file as keyframe data. The chread command can be
  used to read these files.

NOTE:
    If you want to save the contents of a CHOP as a bclip, use the
    opsave command.
