"""Changes options of a Histogram view of a COP image viewer."""

:usage: `imgviewhist [options] <<view_name>> [<<viewport_index>>]`

If viewport_index is specified, only that viewport is affected (1-16).
If it is not specified, all viewports are affected.

NOTE:
    Image viewer names are always of the pattern imgview<<N>> where
    <<N>> = 1,2,3... (e.g. imgview1).

        * 4 = pixel vs. U

        * 5 = pixel vs. V

        * 6 = hue vs. U

        * 7 = hue vs. V
