"""HScript is Houdini's legacy scripting language."""

HScript is still available in Houdini for compatibility with older files and scripts. For new scripts, we recommend you use the [scripting API|/hom/] instead.

Expansion of a Houdini command follows the C shell expansion standards very closely. HScript commands are generally separated by newlines, however you can put multiple commands on a single line separated by semicolons. Commands are used to control anything to do with ui or node states. For example, to control the state of Houdini, change display flags on nodes, dump nodes as scripts, add/delete/copy/paste operators, add/modify/remove parameters on nodes, etc.

See the [HScript language guide|_guide] for more information about using HScript.
