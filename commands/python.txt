#type: hscript

= python =

"""Execute Python statements."""

:usage: `python <<filename>> [arguments]`
:usage: `python -c '<<statements>>'`
:usage: `python`

If you pass in filename and do not use the -c option, this command runs the
Python code in the file.  Any other arguments passed to this function will
be available as arguments in the Python file, accessible via sys.argv.

If the -c option is given, this command runs the Python statements specified
in the argument.  Note that the statements must be in a single argument, so
you need to put quotes around them.

If no arguments or options are given and this command is run from hscript,
it will start an interactive Python shell.  When you exit from this Python
shell, it will return you to the hscript prompt.
