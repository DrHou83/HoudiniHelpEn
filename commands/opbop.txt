:usage: `opbop [-v] <<bundle_pattern>> set|add|remove|filter|lock|unlock <<nodes>> `

@options
    `set|add|remove|filter|lock|unlock`:
        set <<nodes>>:
            Set the contents of the bundle(s) to be the list of nodes.
        add <<nodes>>:
            Add the specified nodes to the contents of the bundle.
        remove <<nodes>>:
            Remove the specified nodes from the bundle.
        filter <<filter_value>>:
            Set the filter of the operator. This makes the bundle able
            to contain only specific types of operators.

            Use `opbfilters` to get a list of valid filter values. Also,
            if no filter name is provided, the list of available filters
            will be printed.

        lock:
            Lock a bundle so Houdini does not automatically add/remove
            nodes. You can still modify the bundle's contents manually.

            That is, when a bundle is locked, its contents only change
            when the user explicitly adds or removes nodes (via the
            add/remove option of `opbop` or through the bundle pane
            interface).

            All bundles are locked when they are created.

        unlock:
            Unlock a bundle so Houdini can automatically add/remove
            operators that match the bundle filter.

            That is, when a bundle is unlocked, Houdini will change its
            contents as nodes that match the filter are created or
            deleted. For example, if the user creates a Light object,
            Houdini will automatically add it to any unlocked bundles
            that allow Light objects.
	
	pattern <<pattern_string>>:
	    Sets the pattern for a bundle. This turns the normal bundle into a
	    smart bundle (if it was not already). The bundle contents will 
	    consist of nodes whose names (or path) match the pattern. If the
	    string_pattern is not specified, the bundle pattern is reset, and
	    the bundle is converted into a normal bundle.

    `-v`:
        (Verbose) Print information about set/add/remove operations.
