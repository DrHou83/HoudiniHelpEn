"""Commits pending key changes."""

:usage: `chcommit [-l] [-p] [-s | -g] [<<channel_patterns>>]`

Executing this command is equivalent to manually clicking the red
keyframe button.

The channels considered are those governed by the main animation
setting. Depending on the setting, either all scoped channels are
considered, or only those which have pending changes. You can explicitly
speicfy one or the other with the -s and -g options.



@options
    `-l`:
        List affected channels without committing them. This lets you
        preview the effects of the command.
    `-p`:
        Key all parameters of the considered channels.
    `-s`:
        Commit scoped channels.
    `-g`:
        Commit pending channels.
    ` <<channel_patterns>> `:
        Only commit channels which match the pattern.
