:usage: `otcontentls [-v] [-l <<source_otl>>] <<table>>/<<operator>> `

modify. A list of valid table names is found in the help for the otwrite
command. The <<operator>> value is the name of the specific operator
type.

    `-v`:
        (Verbose) Show the size and modification time for each section.
    `-l <<source_otl>> `:
        The library in which to find the operator type. If you don't
        specify a <<source_otl>>, the command uses the current
        definition for the operator.
