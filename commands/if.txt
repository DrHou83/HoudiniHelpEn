#type: hscript

= if =

"""Conditionally executes a block of commands if a condition is
true."""

:usage: `if (<<condition>>) [then] ... [else if | else ] ... endif`

If <<condition>> is true, the contents of the if are executed.

NOTE:
    Currently, statements inside the if clause must occur on separate
    lines. That is, statements like "if ($F == 1) echo Frame One" will
    not work.



@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    if ( $F == 1 ) then
        echo Frame One
    else
        echo Not Frame One
    endif
    }}}
