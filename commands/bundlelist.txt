"""Allows different options of a bundle list pane to be set."""

:usage: `bundlelist [-G <<fraction>>] [-g <<on_off>>] [-p <<on_off>>] <<pane1>> [<<pane2>> ...]`

A valid pane name must be specified. If no desk name is given then it
will assume the current desk.



@options
    `-d <<string>> `:
        Desktops to operate on. If it is blank it will default to the
        current desktop
    `-G <<float>> `:
        The horizontal fraction of the pane taken by the bundle list
    `-g <<on_off>> `:
        If on_off is 0, the guessing of the bundle filter based on the
        first operator added is disabled. Otherwise, the bundle filter
        is set automatically to the filter that best matches the first
        set of operators added to the bundle.
    `-p <<on_off>> `:
        If on_off is 1, then full operator paths are displayed in the
        bundle contents list. Otherwise, only operator names are
        displayed. The default value is 0.
