"""Waits for Houdini's UI to update."""

:usage: `updateui`

This command tells Houdini to process any events that have been queuing
up. These events include externally-generated ones like mouse clicks and
keypresses but they also include internally-generated ones that may have
been queued as a result of executing other commands.

This command is not available in hscript.
