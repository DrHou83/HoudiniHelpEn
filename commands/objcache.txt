"""Manipulates the internal object transformation cache."""

:usage: `objcache [-c] [-l] [-L] [-s] [-m <<memory>>] [-M never|always] [-v] [-q]`

The object transformation cache stores the world positions of the
objects whose "Cache Data" parameter is turned on. This command sets
options for object transformation cache.

@options
    `-s`:
        Print the current settings.
    `-l`:
        Print the cache status. This displays the current estimated
        memory use by object transforms.
    `-L`:
        Prints a list of all OBJs that have a cached transform. The full
        path to each OBJ is printed. If the -v option is specified as
        well, the times and transform types are also specified
    `-c`:
        Clear the OBJ cache.
    `-m <<memory>> `:
        Set the maximum memory limit in kB (used by -M)
    `-M never|always`:
        Specifies the behavior when maximum memory limit is reached.
        (never = the memory limit is ignored and cache may use up more
        memory than specified by -m. always = when the memory limit is
        exceeded, the least recently used transform will be replaced by
        new transforms.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    objcache -m 1024
    }}}
    Sets the object cache memory limit to 1MB.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    objcache -l -L
    }}}
    Prints the information about the cache usage and lists the objects
    whose transformations have been cached.
