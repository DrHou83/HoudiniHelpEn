= chkeyget =

"""Samples channels at given times and returns key information."""

:usage: `chkeyget [-q] [-e] [-t] [-s | -S | [-f] [-v] [-V] [-m] [-M] [-a] [-A]] <<channel_patterns>> <<times_or_frames>>`

NOTE:
    Partial key information options can be used together.

NOTE:
    <<times_or_frames>> can be a list of times or frames as specified by
    the -t or -f flags. The default is frames.



@options
    `-q`:
        Quiet mode. Don't report any errors.
    `-e`:
        Only display the times at either end of the range.
    `-t`:
        Times are specified in seconds, instead of frames (frames are
        the default), and the values returned are in seconds instead of
        frames.
    `-s`:
        Prints out hscript "chkey" commands instead of key times. This
        is the default.
    `-S`:
        Same as -s, except the chkey commands do not omit, which might
        make the output easier to parse.
    `-v`:
        Print partial key information: the value entering the key.
    `-V`:
        Print partial key information: the value leaving the key.
    `-m`:
        Print partial key information: the slope entering the key.
    `-M`:
        Print partial key information: the slope leaving the key.
    `-a`:
        Print partial key information: the acceleration entering the
        key.
    `-A`:
        Print partial key information: the acceleration leaving the
        key.
    `-f`:
        Print partial key information: the frame of each key. Time is
        used if -f is combined with -t.
