= history =

"""Prints the command history."""

:usage: `history [-c]`

this matches the Ctrl-RMB history, but differs from the up/down arrow
history. The up/down arrow history replaces duplicate commands, while
this shows the complete history.



@options
    `-c`:
        Clears the command history.
