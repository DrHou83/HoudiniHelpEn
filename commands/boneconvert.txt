"""Updates bones from old Houdini 4 hip files."""

:usage: `boneconvert [-r | -m] [-x] [-t] [-s] [-g]`

NOTE:
    To convert bones created in hip files prior to Houdini 4, use the
    kinconvert command first, and then this command.

The conversions currently performed are:

* All bones which have lock channels in their translate parameters are
  removed and replaced with a locked parameter with values of 0 instead.
  To force this conversion, use the -t option.

* The Top Cap and Bottom parameters in the cregion SOP of bone objects
  have their multiplication factor removed and multiplied into the
  values of the object-level cregion parameters. This will only be
  performed if the object-level cregion parameters have no channels. To
  deal with special cases, please see the options described below.

* All bone objects have their xray flag turned on. Use the -x option to
  avoid doing this conversion.

* Adds the command "bonefixchops $OPSUBNAME" to the delete script.

* The scale parameters should all be 1 and be locked. To force this
  conversion use -s.

* The bone geometry is updated to the current system. To force this
  conversion use -g.

* The Kinematic Solver parameter is filled with the path of the CHOP
  overridding its rotate parameter.

@options
    `-r`:
        Forces the conversion of the cregion SOP parameters even if the
        object-level cregion parameters already have channels. This
        option is useful if you have channel references in the
        object-level parameters that mirror other capture regions. The
        cregion SOP parameters are forced to be correct without
        interpretation of the parameter.
    `-m`:
        only forces the conversion of the cregion SOP parameters like
        -r, but it will also attempt to add the multiplication factor if
        the object-level parameters have channels on them. This option
        will not have different behavior if the object-level cregion
        parameters do not have channels. It will also fail to add the
        multiplication factor if the cregion SOP parameters do not have
        an expression of the form <<number>>*<<expression>>.
