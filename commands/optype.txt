"""Prints type-specific information about operators."""

:usage: `optype [-N] [-t] [-e] [-n] [-s] [-i] [-T] [-o] <<op_name>> `

If you don't specify any options, the command prints all information in
a human-readable format. If you specify one or more options, the command
prints only the values for those options.



@options
    `-N`:
        The name of the node, likely same as opname.
    `-t`:
        The operator type of the node. For example, /obj/model will
        usually be type "geo".
    `-e`:
        The label of the type. An op of type "geo" will usually have the
        label "Geometry". Be careful as this label may contain spaces.
    `-n`:
        The network type of the node. In the case of /obj/model this
        would be "OBJ". Possible return types are: OBJ, SOP, PART, POP,
        MAT, TOP, CHOPNET, CHOP, ROP, SHOP, COP2, IMG, VOP, VOPNET, MGR,
        and DIR.
    `-s`:
        The script directory of the optype. This is used internally to
        locate some files related to the operator. Possible values are:
        obj, sop, part, pop, mat, top, ch, chop, out, shop, img, cop2,
        vop, vex, mgr, and dir.
    `-i`:
        The index of the network type. This is a number which is unique
        for each of the network types. It can be used to index into a
        table, for example. However, the mapping of network types (-n)
        to indices (-i) is not guaranteed to be consistent between
        Houdini versions.
    `-T`:
        The table name of the network type. This matches the table names
        used by other commands. Possible values are: Object, Sop,
        Particle, Pop, Material, Texture, ChopNet, Chop, Driver, Shop,
        Cop2, CopNet, Vop, VopNet, Manager, and Director.
    `-o`:
        The table name and operator name, separated by a "/". This is
        the format required for most operator type commands such as
        otwrite and otdelete.
