"""Prints a list of available DOP data types."""

:usage: `dopdatatypes [-n]`

Prints a list of the low level DOP data types dynamic simulations
(DOPs) may use. This command is useful for showing the data type names
you can use with the [dopdatahint|Cmd:dopdatahint] and
[dopsolveadddata|Cmd:dopsolveadddata] commands.

Most DOPs data types have a corresponding dynamics operator (DOP). For
information about these data types, view the online help for the
corresponding DOP. Use the `-n` option to print only data types with
corresponding DOPs, and the names of the DOPs.



@options
    `-n`:
        Print a list of both data type names and the names of the
        corresponding dynamics operator (DOP). Only print data types
        with corresponding DOPs.
