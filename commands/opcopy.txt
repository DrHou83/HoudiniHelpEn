"""Copies an operator and its dependencies to the clipboard."""

:usage: `opcopy [-d] [-e] [-i] [-o] <<operator>> `

This command is similar to the UI operation of copying/paste, however it
will also copy all operators which the specified operator depends on.

If no options are given, -d and -o (dependencies and outputs) are
copied.

You can paste the copies back into the scene with oppaste.



@options
    `-d`:
        Copy operators which the operator depends on as well.
    `-i`:
        Copy the input nodes of the operator as well.
    `-o`:
        Copy the output nodes of the operator as well.
    `-e`:
        Copy the "extra" nodes of the operator as well. Extra nodes are
        nodes referenced indirectly (via an expression).

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opcopy /obj/geo1
    }}}
    
    {{{
    #!hscript
    oppaste /obj
    }}}
