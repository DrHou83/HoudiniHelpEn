= tset =

"""Gets/sets the global animation range."""

:usage: `tset [<<start_time>> <<end_time>>]`

If no time range is specified, the current time range is printed out.
Otherwise, the time range is set to the given inclusive range. Values
are specified in seconds.



@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    tset `(10-1)/$FPS` `87/$FPS`
    }}}
    This sets the global animation range to be from frame 10 to frame
    87. In the <<start_time>> value, we need to subtract 1 first before
    dividing by $FPS (the frames per second) because frame 1 is at time
    0. For the <<end_time>> value, we do not subtract by 1 in order to
    obtain an inclusive time range.
