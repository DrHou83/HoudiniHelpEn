"""Show or hide shaders based on the renderer."""

:usage: `shopvisible`
:usage: `shopvisible [+|-]<<client>> `

With no arguments, the command displays the list of available clients.

When you specify a client, you can prefix the name with a + to turn it
on, or a - to turn it off. If you don't specify a + or -, the current
state of the client is toggled.

Turning clients off hides the operators in the toolbars, simplifying the
interface. This command does _not_ remove the operators. So any existing
operators will remain, opadd will still add operators, etc.

NOTE:
    For graphical applications, this command will cause all dialog
    scripts for all SHOPs to load and may cause a significant
    performance hit if many SHOPs are loaded over a busy network.



@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    shopvisible -RIB +VMantra
    }}}
    Disable the RenderMan renderer button in the toolbars,
    and enable VMantra buttons.
