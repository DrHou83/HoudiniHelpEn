"""Marks node types as deprecated and hides them from the tab menu."""

:usage: `opdeprecate [[-r <<reason>>] <<version>> <<networktype>> [<<nodetype>> ...]]`

`opdeprecate` marks a node type as being deprecated. The version number should be
a valid Houdini version number. The deprecation warnings are printed when a 
scene using a deprecated node type is loaded. Marking a node deprecated will
also hide it. If this is not wanted, call [Cmd:opunhide] afterward on the
same node type.

An optional reason can be specified, which will also be displayed. This can be
used, for example, to indicate which new node type the deprecated node type 
was replaced with, or why it got removed.

@options
    `-r`:
        Specify a reason why the node type was removed. If the reason is a
        name of another node type, this new node type will be displayed. By
        default, the node type given will be assumed to be of the same 
        network type. If not, the network type can be prefixed (e.g. "Sop/grid").
        If the reason does not resolve into a node type, then the message will
        be shown verbatim.
