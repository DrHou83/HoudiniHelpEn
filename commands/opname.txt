@options
    `-u`:
	If the <<new_name>> is the name of an existing node, it is
	modified to make it unique. The name is made unique by appending
	or incremeting a numeric suffix on the name.
    `-v-:
	If this command succeeds, this option causes it to output the new name 
	of the node. This is useful in conjunction with the -u option.
