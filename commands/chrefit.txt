"""Refits the channels using cubic interpolation."""

:usage: `chrefit [-v] [-l] [-r|-R <<start>> <<end>>] [-t <<tolerance>>] <<channel_patterns>> `

Refits the channels using cubic interpolation, deletes keys and inserts
new ones where appropriate.

This is useful when a channel has too many keys and needs to be
simplified by approximating it with a cubic interpolation. This command
obtains the channel values for each frame and fits curve segments
through them within a given tolerance.

The key are inserted at the boundaries of the approximating curve
segments. If option -l is specified, keys are inserted at the local
maxima and minima.

If the range is specified with either -r or -R option, the channel is
refitted only within this interval. These options can be also used to
extend the channel length, which is useful for channels that contain
expressions such as 'sin($F)'.



@options
    `-v`:
        Print verbose output.
    `-l`:
        Key local maxima and minima.
    `-t <<tolerance>> `:
        The tolerance for fitting the existing channel data to the new
        curve. If you don't specify a tolerance, the command defaults to
        0.01.
    `-r <<start>> <<end>> `:
        Defines a time interval within which to refit the channel.
    `-R <<start>> <<end>> `:
        Defines a frame range within which to refit the channel.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    chrefit /obj/model/tx
    }}}
    Refits tx channel for /obj/model/.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    chrefit -t 1.0 /obj/model/t?
    }}}
    Refits all translates (and two-letter channels that start with t)
    with the tolerance of 1.0

    {{{
    #!hscript
    chrefit -v -t 0.0001 /obj/obj1/*
    }}}
    Refits all channels in /obj/obj1 with the tolerance of 0.0001 and
    requesting the verbose report on the operation

    {{{
    #!hscript
    chrefit -R 10 20 /obj/obj1/rz
    }}}
    Refits a rotation around z (rz) channel of obj1 object between frame
    10 and frame 20
