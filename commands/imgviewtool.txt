:usage: `imgviewtool [-t <<tool_name>>] <<view_name>> `

This command sets the currently active tool in an image viewer (that is,
the selected tool that shows its options in the operator control toolbar
and acts on mouse clicks and key presses). This command simulates the
effect of the user choosing a tool in the viewer, such as via the [tab
menu|/basics/tabmenu] .If no options are specified, then this command
lists all the available tools for the given viewer.

Use the [imgviewls|Cmd:imgviewls] command to list the available image
viewers.



@options
    `-t <<tool_name>>`:
        Name of the tool to select in the viewer.

        This is the _internal_ name of the tool, not the name that
        usually shows up in the user interface, for example `xform`
        instead of `Transform`.

        Use this command without any options to obtain the list of
        available tools.


@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    imgviewtool imgview1 
    }}}
    Prints a list of tools available in the scene viewer named
    `imgview1`.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    imgviewtool -t file imgview1 
    }}}
    Selects the [File COP|Node:cop2/file] in the image viewer named
    `imgview1`.
