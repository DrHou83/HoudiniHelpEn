"""Create an operator type library from separate files."""

:usage: `otcollapse <<otl_file>> <<source_dir>> `

This command rebuilds an operator type library file from the specified
directory. The directory must contain an index file with a list of files
on disk to include in the operator type library.

The index file and disk files can be created from an existing operator
type library using the otexpand command.

The combination of otexpand and otcollapse lets you extract component
files from an OTL with otexpand, edit them, then rebuild the OTL with
otcollapse.

The command takes two arguments: the <<otl_file>> to create, and the
<<source_dir>> containing the index and component files.
