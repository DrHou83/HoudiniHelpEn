= panepath =

"""Sets the current node of all panes in a desk."""

:usage: `panepath [-d <<desk_name>>] [-f] [-p <<pane_name>>] <<new_path>>`

This command only affects panes that match the given <<new_path>> up to
the last folder. For example, if you have a pane viewing
/obj/model/box1, and call panepath /obj/model/sphere1, the pane will
change to point to the sphere. If you call /obj/cam1, the pane will not
change. If the -f option is not specified, this change only occurs if
the pane currently matches the path up to the last directory.

@options
    `-d <<desk_name>> `:
        The desk on which to modify the panes. If no desk name is given
        the command will assume the current desk.
    `-f`:
        Allows the full path to be set.
    `-p <<pane_name>>`:
        The pane name for which to set the new path. If this option is
        not present, the path is set for all the panes.
