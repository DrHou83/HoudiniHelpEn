= opadd =

"""Adds an operator to the network."""

:usage: `opadd [-e] [-i] [-n] [-u] [-v] <<type>> [<<name>>] [<<name2>> ...]`

With no arguments, the command prints a list of operators.

If you specify a type, the command adds an operator of that type with a
generic name.

If you specify names, the command creates operators with the given
names.



@options
    `-e`:
	Use the operator type name exactly as it is given. Otherwise,
	the type name may be first used to match the preferred operator type.
	For example "hda" may match a preferred operator "hda::2.0", which 
	is a newer and therefore preferred version of the operator. Similarly,
	if there are two operators available, "namespaceA::hda" and
	"namespaceB::hda", and "namespaceB" has precedence, then the 
	created node will be of preferred type "namespaceB::hda".
    `-i`:
        Ignores nodes that already exist.
    `-n`:
        Prevents the initialization script from running.
    `-u`:
        Prevents any subnet contents from being loaded for custom subnet
        operators.
    `-v`:
        Prints the name of the created operator.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opadd geo arms legs
    }}}
    Creates two geo objects called "arms" and "legs"
