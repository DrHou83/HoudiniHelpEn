"""Enables/disables auto saving."""

:usage: `autosave on|off`

Turn auto save on to periodically save a copy of the current file. The
interval between saves and other options are set in the __Save Options__ section
of the [Houdini Preferences|/ref/windows/mainprefs#save] window.

This command is not available in hscript.

    NOTE:
        Auto save will revert to "off" when re-launching Houdini.
