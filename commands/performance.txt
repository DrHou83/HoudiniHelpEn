= performance =

"""Set various options of the performance monitor."""

Note: This only affects the performance monitor panetab in the Houdini UI.  It
does not work in hscript or hython.  Use the `perfmon` command in those cases.


:usage: `performance [<<options>>] panetabname1 [panetabname2 ...]`
