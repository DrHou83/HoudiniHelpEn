"""Copies all operator type definitions from one library file to
another."""

:usage: `otmerge <<source_otl_file>> <<dest_otl_file>> `

NOTE:
    If <<source_otl_file>> and <<dest_otl_file>> have the same operator
    type defined, the command will _not_ overwrite the definition in
    <<dest_otl_file>>.
