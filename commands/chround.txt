= chround =

"""Moves or replaces keys so that they lie on integer frame values."""

:usage: `chround [-v] [-s|-S|-r|-R] -a`
:usage: `chround [-v] [-s|-S|-r|-R] channel_patterns`

If you specify a channel pattern, only keys on channels matching the
pattern will be shifted. Otherwise, use the -a option to shift keys on
all channels.

This command is useful after changing the frame rate (FPS) of an
animation which causes keys at the old frame rate to no longer lie on
integer frame times at the new frame rate.



@options
    `-s`:
        Snap non-integer keys to nearest frame without changing values.

        NOTE:
            This is the default.

        NOTE:
            If many keys snap to a single integer frame, the nearest one
            is snapped. The rest will remain on non-integer frames.

    `-S`:
        Like -s, except remove non-integer keys that cannot snap.
    `-r`:
        Insert replacement keys beside non-integer keys, then removes
        non-integer keys.
    `-R`:
        Like -r, except insert keys on either side.

        NOTE:
            This will perfectly preserve curve shape for cubics and
            beziers

    `-a`:
        Shift keys on all channels.
    `-v`:
        Print verbose output: print all keys modified with old and new
        key positions.
