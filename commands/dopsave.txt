"""Saves the entire state of a DOP simulation to a file."""

:usage: `dopsave <<dopnet>> <<filename>> `

Use this command to save the entire current state of a DOP simulation
to a file. Simulation states can also be saved and loaded in a
procedural manner using a File DOP. This command allows the saving to
occur as part of a script without editing the DOP Network. The files
generated by this command can be loaded with a File DOP.
