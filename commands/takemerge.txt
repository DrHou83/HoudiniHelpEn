"""Merges included parameters from one or more source takes into a
destination take."""

:usage: `takemerge [-f] <<destination_take>> <<source_take1>> [<<source_take2>> ...]`

NOTE:
    If you specify multiple sources, they are merged in the order they
    occur on the command line.

@options
    `-f`:
        Force: if a source take has the same included parameter as the
        destination, the source will overwrite the destination. If you
        do not specify this flag, source files will _not_ overwrite data
        in the destination.
