"""Set various onion skinning display options for a viewport."""

:usage: `viewonionskin [<<options>>] <<viewports>> `

This command can be used to change display options relating to onion skin
rendering on a single viewport or multiple viewports. Onion skinning is enabled
on a [geometry object|Node:obj/geo] by turning on the Onion Skinning parameter 
in the Misc tab.

See [how to refer to viewers and viewports|/commands/_guide#viewers].

@options
   `-a <<skins_after>>`:
       Sets the number of skins that follow the current animation. These are
       spaced 'frame_increment' apart, working back from the current frame.

   `-b <<skins_before>>`:
       Sets the number of skins that precede the current animation. These are
       spaced 'frame_increment' apart, working forward from the current frame.

   `-e on|off`:
       Globally turn onion skinning on or off. When off, all onion skinning
       is disabled, regardless of the setting of the objects' Onion Skinning 
       parameter.

   `-i <<frame_increment>>`:
       Set the number of frames between skins. A frame increment of 1 will 
       not skip any frames. A small frame increment is good for visualizing 
       quick animations, whereas larger frame increments is good for slower
       ones.

   `-A <<frame_after_color>>`:
       Tint the skins that follow the current animation by this color. The 
       default, white, does not apply any tint.

   `-B <<frame_before_color>>`:
       Tint the skins that precede the current animation by this color. The 
       default, white, does not apply any tint.

   `-o <<skin_opacity>>`:
       Sets the opacity for the skins. An opacity of 1.0 makes the skin opaque,
       while values closer to zero make it easier to see through the skins.
