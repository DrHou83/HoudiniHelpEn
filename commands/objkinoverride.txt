:usage: `objkinoverride [none|rest|capture]`

With no arguments, the command prints the current kinematic override
setting.



@options
    `[none|rest|capture]`:
        Sets the kinematic override option to:

        none:
            (Default) No override: bones are affected by transformations
            and/or kinematic chop solvers.
        rest:
            Rest position: bones are shown in their rest pose, and no
            kinematic solvers affect their displayed position.
        capture:
            Capture pose: bones are shown in their capture position, no
            kinematic solvers or local transformation are in effect.
