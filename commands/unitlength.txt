"""Controls the Houdini Unit Length option."""

:usage: `unitlength [<<new_unit_length>>]`

If no parameters are specified to this command, it outputs the current
Unit Length value. This is the same value that appears in the Hip File Options
page of the Houdini Preferences dialog. A number can also be supplied as a
parameter which changes the Unit Length value. The number is interpreted
as a length in meters.
