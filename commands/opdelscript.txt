= opdelscript =

"""Gets or sets a script to run when an operator is deleted."""

:usage: `opdelscript [-c <<delete_script>>] [-a] <<node>> [<<node2>> ...]`

If you don't specify a script with -c, the command prints the current
delete script for the operator.

@options
    `-c <<delete_script>> `:
        Sets the script to run when the operator is deleted.
    `-a`:
        The script line given with -c is appended to the current delete
        script instead of overwriting it.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opdelscript -c 'unix echo Deleting Object' geo*
    }}}
    
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opdelscript -a -c 'unix echo Still Deleting Object' geo*
    }}}
