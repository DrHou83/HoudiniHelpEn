:usage: `omparm <<manip_name>> <<manip_type>> <<op_node_name>> <<settings>> `

For the given handle (handle) and operator node, set the handle's
settings to the specified settings string. These settings will be used
the next time the user enters the state for this operator node.

The values for the settings are specific to the type of handle and are
undocumented. This command is used internally to save handle settings to
the hip file.
