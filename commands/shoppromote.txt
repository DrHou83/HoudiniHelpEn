"""Automatically promotes all parameters from a material's
contained shaders onto the material."""

:usage: `shoppromote [-c [-f]] <<material_path>>`

Without options, this command takes all the parameters from
the shaders contained in a material and copies them onto
the material itself. You can then prune and organize the
parameters as desired. This is usually faster than promoting
parameters from the shaders one-by-one.

This is the same as right-clicking a [Material|Node:shop/vopmaterial]
node and choosing __Promote Material Parameters__.

@options

`-c`:
    Clear automatically promoted parameters.
    
`-f`:
    Force clearing of all user-added parameters on the material.
    (used with -c).
    
    When you use `shoppromote` or the __Promote Material Parameters__
    menu item, Houdini marks the parameters and you can easily
    remove them with `-c`. If you've manually promoted parameters,
    they won't have the special mark and you'll need to use `-f`
    to clear them.
    
    WARNING:
        This will remove _all_ user-added parameters, whether
        they were promoted from shaders or not.
