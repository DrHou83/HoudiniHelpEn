= otload =

"""Loads an operator type library into the current session."""

:usage: `otload [-n] [-f] <<hda_file>> [<<install_source>>]`

Performs the same function as the Install Digital Asset Library item in
the Houdini File menu.

The <<hda_file>> value is the name of the operator type library file to
load.

If you don't specify a <<install_source>>, the library is loaded only into
the current Houdini session. The library file name will also be saved in
the Hip file so when you edit the same Hip file in the future, the
library will be loaded automatically. This is equivalent to using
"Current HIP file" as the <<install_source>>.

If you specify an "OPlibraries" file with the <<install_source>>
argument, Houdini will add the name of the library to the file.
"OPlibraries" files are text files containing lists of library files for
Houdini to load on startup. When Houdini starts up, it searches your
HOUDINI_PATH environment variable for files with the name "OPlibraries"
and loads the listed libraries.

By creating OPlibraries files in appropriate locations in your
HOUDINI_PATH ($HOME, $JOB, $HFS) you can set up some libraries that are
to be loaded into all Houdini sessions, some specific to a particular
job, some specific to a particular user, and so on.

If <<install_source>> is "Scanned OTL Directories", then is equivalent to the
installation menu entry in the Install Digital Asset Library dialog.

@options
    `-n`:
        Do not try to modify the OPlibraries file. This argument is
        useful when the OPlibraries file contains wild cards that would
        cause the new library to be loaded if Houdini were restarted.
        This way a new OTL file can be loaded into Houdini without
        disturbing the OPlibraries contents.
    `-f`:
        Ensure that the asset definitions contained in this OTL are used
	as the current asset definitions. This sets an explicit preference
	for these definitions if required.
