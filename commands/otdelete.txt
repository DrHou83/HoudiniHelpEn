"""Deletes operator definitions from an operator type library."""

:usage: `otdelete [-v] <<table>>/<<operator>> [<<table>>/<<operator>> ...] <<hda_file>> `

The <<table>> value specifies the class of the operator you want to
modify. A list of valid table names is found in the help for the otwrite
command. The <<operator>> value is the name of the specific operator
type. Either or both or the <<table>> and <<operator>> values can
contain wild card characters. Any number of <<table>>/<<operator>> pairs
can be specified.

The <<hda_file>> is the name of the operator type library file from
which the definitions are to be deleted.

If you delete an operator in use by Houdini, and there are no other
definitions for this operator available in other operator type
libraries, an empty replacement operator definition is added to the
embedded operator type library in the .hip file. This embedded definition
will not be saved to disk until you save the Hip file, and then only if
the option to save operator definitions to the Hip file is on.

@options
