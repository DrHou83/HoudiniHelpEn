= takels =

"""Prints the names of existing takes."""

:usage: `takels [-l] [-m] [-i] [-p parent] [-q] [<<take_pattern>>]`

By default, the command prints the names of all takes. If you specify a
<<take_pattern>>, the command lists the takes whose names match the
pattern.



@options
    `-l`:
        List the contents of the given take(s).
    `-m`:
        List the memory usage of the given take(s).
    `-i`:
        Do not indent the listing.
    `-p`:
	Only list takes which have the given parent.
    `-q`:
	If no takes match the pattern do not print anything rather
	than printing a warning message.
