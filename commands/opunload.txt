"""Causes a node to throw away any cached geometry."""

:usage: `opunload [-f] [-R] <<nodes>>`

You can specify a node path, a list of node paths, or one or more wildcards
(for example, `/obj/foo*` for all nodes at the object level starting with `foo`).

Currently, unloading only works for surface nodes (SOPs). When you unload a
surface node, the node frees any cached geometry it has (this probably won't
decrease the amount of memory Houdini uses, but it makes the memory available
elsewhere in Houdini).

This is similar to using the [unload flag|/nodes/sop/_index#unload].
When the unload flag is on a node will not cache its geometry, which is useful
for ancestral nodes in the networks of static props and other non-time-dependent
objects. This command does not set the unload flag, but rather simply orders one
or more nodes to dump any cached geometry they may have.

@options

`-f`:
    Do not unload "flagged" nodes (nodes with the display, template, footprint,
    export, or audio flags). The command prints a message when it skips a
    flagged node.
    
`-R`:
    Recursively unload the children of the specified nodes as well.
