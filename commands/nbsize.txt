"""Resizes network boxes"""

:usage: `nbsize [-s] [-d] [-x <<xval>>] [-y <<yval>>] [-w <<wval>>] [-h <<hval>>] networkbox_pattern`

Resizes the specified network boxes in the network view. All
coordinates, width, and height values are in absolute units on the
network, and are unchanged by panning or zooming on the network. Use
the -s option to automatically snap to a snug fit around the boxes'
contents, or use the -x, -y, -w and -h options to manually resize the
network box to the desired dimensions. If none of -s, -x, -y, -w or -h
are specified, the current size is printed.

@options
    `-s`:
        Snaps the size of the network box to the minimum bounding box
        enclosing its contents. Includes a small border of buffer space
        around its contents.
    `-d`:
        The -x, -y, -w, and -h specified are deltas and are added to the
        current values for the network box.
    `-x`:
        Specifies the X position of the lower left corner of the network
        box. Does not move the entire network box as with oplocate.
    `-y`:
        Specifies the Y position of the lower left corner of the network
        box. Does not move the entire network box as with oplocate.
    `-w`:
        Specifies the width relative to the X position of the network
        box
    `-h`:
        Specifies the height relative to the Y position of the network
        box

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    nbsize -s netbox1
    }}}
    Adjusts the size of box1 to match its minimum bounding box.
