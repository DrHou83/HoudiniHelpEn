""" Copies some DOP data from one location to another when running a
[Script Solver DOP|Node:dop/scriptsolver]. """

:usage: `dopsolvecopydata [-i sourceobject] <<object_index>> <<sourcedataname>> <<destdataname>> `

This is one of a set of commands for use by the [Script Solver
DOP|Node:dop/scriptsolver]. Calling this command will generate an error
if a script solver is not currently solving for objects.

This command copies DOP data from one location on one object to another
location on another object. By default the source and destination
objects are the same. Use the -o option to specify a different source
object. The object index provided as the destination object is not the
DOP object identifier, but an index into the array of objects being
solved by the current script solver.

Unlike most object specifications in script solver commands, the -o
option does not take an index into the set of objects being solved.
Instead, the object id, object name, or group name for the source object
can be used. This difference is because the source object does not have
to be one of the objects being solved. It can be any object in the
simulation.

The source and destination data names can contain slashes to fetch (or
create) subdata on other data.

@options
    `-o sourceobject`:
        Specifies a source object that may be different from the
        destination object. The source object can be any object in the
        simulation (not just one of the objects being solved by the
        script solver). The object can be specified by name, unique
        object identifier, or group name.
