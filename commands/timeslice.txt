:usage: `timeslice [-m <<slice_size>>] [-d on|off] [-c smart|always]`




@options
    `-m <<slice_size>> `:
        Limit the maximum size (in frames) of a timeslice that can be
        processed in one cook.
    `-d on|off`:
        If on, all newly created CHOPs that have timeslice capability
        will be created with their timeslice flag on.
    `-c smart|always`:
        Enable smart or constant timeslice cooking. When set to smart,
        some timeslice CHOPs will cook only when needed, instead being
        completely time dependent.
