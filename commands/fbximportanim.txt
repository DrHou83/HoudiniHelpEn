"""Imports a single Filmbox FBX animation curve."""

== Property names ==

The list below contains standard property names as defined by the FBX format, with spaces replaced
by underscores. Properties with multiple channels have the number of channels list in brackets.

General properties ||
	"Lcl+Translation" (3), "Lcl+Rotation" (3), "Lcl+Scaling" (3), "Visibility"

Optical marker node properties ||
	"Occlusion"

Light node properties ||
	"Cone+angle", "Fog", "Intensity", "Color" (3)

Camera node properties ||
	"FieldOfView", "FieldOfViewX", "FieldOfViewY", "FocalLength", "OpticalCenterX", "OpticalCenterY", "Roll", "TurnTable", "BackgroundColor" (3)

:usage: `fbximportanim -n <<node_name>> -p <<parm_name>> -i <<parm_idx>> -k <<fbx_node_name>> -c <<property_name>> -b <<property_idx>> [-r on|off] [-f <<sample_freq>>] [-t <<fbx_take_name>>] <<filename>>`

@options

`-n <<node_name>>`:
    The name of the Houdini node to whose parameter the imported animation curve will be assigned. Can
    be a path relative to /obj, or an absolute path.
	
`-p <<parm_name>>`:
    Specifies the name of a Houdini parameter to which the animation curve will be assigned.
	
`-i <<parm_idx>>`:
    The channel index of the parameter above.
	
`-k <<fbx_node_name>>`:
    The name of the FBX node to get the animation curve from.
    
`-c <<property_name>>`:
    The name of the FBX property name to extract the animation curve from. Note that while some
    FBX property names contain spaces, they should be replaced with a plus symbol when specified here.
    For example, FBX property "Lcl Scaling" becomes "Lcl+Scaling" here.
    
`-b <<property_index>>`:
    The index (channel) of the FBX property above. If the property has no sub-indices (for example, 
    camera's focal length), this must be set to -1.
    
`-r on|off`:
    Specifies whether to force animation curve resampling. If on, the curve will be resampled.

`-f <<sample_freq>>`:
    Sampling frequency, in frames, for curves that must be resampled. Defaults to 1.0.
    
`-t <<fbx_take_name>>`:
    The name of the FBX take to import animation from. If this is omitted, the first animation
    take is used.

@examples

{{{
#!hscript
fbximportanim -n geo1 -p t -i 0 -k camera1 -c Lcl+Translation -b 2 c:/camera_anim.fbx
}}}

Imports the Z component of the local translation of the FBX object named `camera1` and assigns
it to the X translational component of the `/obj/geo1` Houdini node.
