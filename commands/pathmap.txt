"""Interface to modify or test the HOUDINI_PATHMAP variable."""

:usage: `pathmap -a <<source_dir>> <<dest_dir>>`
:usage: `pathmap -r <<source_dir>>`
:usage: `pathmap [-c] -t <<path>>`
:usage: `pathmap [-c]`

This command allows you to inspect or modify the HOUDINI_PATHMAP variable.
This variable is used to map one directory to another.

@options

The `-a` option adds a new mapping to the HOUDINI_PATHMAP variable.
The `-r` option removes a mapping from the HOUDINI_PATHMAP variable.

The `-t` option allows you to test the mapping of a path.  With the `-c` option, only the resulting mapping will be printed.

With no options, the existing HOUDINI_PATHMAP is printed out.  With the `-c` option, the map will be printed compactly (on a single line).

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    pathmap -a "C:/temp" "/tmp"
    pathmap -a "/tmp" "C:/temp"
    }}}
    Add a mapping from the `C:/temp` directory to the `/tmp`, but also add a
    mapping from `/tmp` to `C:/temp`.  On a Windows system, users could enter
    `/tmp/Mandril.pic` and have it map automatically to `C:/temp/Mandril.pic`
    directory.  This example could be used to map directories on a Windows file
    system to provide access on a Linux system.
