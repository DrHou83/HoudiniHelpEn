"""Changes the initial shape of a node when it is put down."""

:usage: `opdefaultshape [<<networktype>> [<<opname>>] [<<defaultshape>>]]`
:usage: `opdefaultshape [-c] [<<networktype>>]`
:usage: `opdefaultshape [-a|-r] <<nodepath>>`

When just the `networktype` option is specified, all current `opdefaultshape`
commands for that network type are displayed. If no options are given,
all `opdefaultshape` commands for all network types are displayed.

This is usually added to the OPcustomize file.  This allows for control over
the initial shape of new nodes.  If no `opname` argument is given, the
supplied `defaultshape` is used for all nodes of the specified `networktype`
that do not have an explicit default shape set.

The second usage clears all default shape settings, either for a single
network type, or for all network types. This is a quick way to reset any
defaults established in OPcustomize files earlier in the search path.

The third usage applies default shapes to existing nodes. Existing shape
assignments are replaced. If the `-r` option is used, the default shapes
are set on all child nodes as well. The `-a` option only affects the
specified node.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opdefaultshape Dop bulge 
    opdefaultshape Sop merge oval
    opdefaultshape -r /
    }}}
    causes new merge SOPs to be created with an oval shape, and
    all new DOPs to be created with the bulge shape. The third line
    causes all existing nodes in the current Houdini session to be set
    to their default shape.
