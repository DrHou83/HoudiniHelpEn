"""Imports a Filmbox FBX file."""

:usage: `fbximport [-n] [-f fps] [-p abs|rel] [-t on|off] [-s vex|vop] [-v float|double] [-u none|geo|def|all] [<obj_filter> on|off] <<filename>> `

@options
    `-n`:
        Starts a new Houdini session before importing the FBX file.
    `-f fps`:
        Specifies a frame rate to override FBX file's internal frame rate with. If this option
        is absent, FBX file's internal frame rate will be used.
    `-o on|off`:
        If on, the FBX file is imported directly into /obj subnet, instead of having a new subnet created
        for each FBX file.
    `-p abs|rel`:
		Determines whether imported FBX file paths will be kept absolute or converted to relative paths.
		Defaults to relative paths.

        The following values are supported:
        
        abs:
			All file paths are stored as absolute paths.

        rel:
			All file paths are made relative to the `$HIP` path. 
        
    `-u none|geo|def|all`:
        Specified which nodes will be left unlocked after import.
        
        The following values are supported:
        
        none:
			Both geometry (File SOPs) and deformations (File CHOPs) will be locked.

        geo:
			Geometry (File SOPs) will be unlocked, while deformations (File CHOPs) will be locked.
			
        def:
			Deformations (File CHOPs) will be unlocked, while geometry (File SOPs) will be locked.			
			
        all:
			Both geometry (File SOPs) and deformations (File CHOPs) will be unlocked.
        
    `-t on|off`:
        If set to "on", forces the importer to triangulate NURBS and patch surfaces. This is off by default.
        
    `-s vex|vop`:
        Specifies how materials should be imported. The default is as VEX FBX shaders.
        
        vex:
			Materials are imported as special VEX FBX shaders.
		
		vop:
			Materials are imported as general VOP networks.

	`-v float|double`:
		Specifies how the importer should treat vertex caches. The default assumes double-precision vertex caches.
		
		float:
			All vertex caches are assumed to be stored as single precision (float) types.
		
		double:
			All vertex caches are assumed to be stored as double precision types.
        
    `<obj_filter> on|off`:
        "on" turns the object filter on. "off" turns the object filter off.

        You can set the following object filters:

        -c:
            Imports camera objects. The default is "on".
        -g:
            Imports geometry objects. The default is "on".
        -j:
            Imports joints and skin objects. The default is "on".
        -k:
            Imports keyframe animations. The default is "off".
        -l:
            Imports light objects. The default is "on".
        -m:
            Imports textures and materials. The default is "on".
        
    `-a maya|off`:
        If set to "maya", the importer will try to be compatible with FBX files from Maya, instead of the FBX standard. This is off by default.
        
    `-b on|off`:
        If set to "on", the importer will import blend deformers as Blend SOPs. This is off by default.
        
    `-h on|off`:
        If set to "on", the importer will hide joints attached to skin. This is off by default.
        
    `-i on|off`:
        If set to "on", the importer will import null nodes as subnets. This is on by default.
        
    `-r on|off`:
        If set to "on", the importer will resample all cubic curves. This is off by default.  If using this, use `-q` to set the interval between samples, in frames.
        
    `-q <frames_between_samples>`:
        When resampling curves, this specifies the number of frames between each sample.  1.0 by default.  Use `-r on` if all cubic curves should be resampled.
        

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    fbximport Seymour.fbx
    }}}
    Imports scene from Seymour.fbx into the current Houdini session.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    fbximport -n -f 24 Seymour.fbx
    }}}
    Starts a new Houdini session and then imports the scene from
    Seymour.fbx, forcing the file to be imported at 24 fps.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    fbximport -c off -k on Seymour.fbx
    }}}
    Imports the scene and animation from Seymour.fbx into the current
    Houdini session. Cameras are not imported.
