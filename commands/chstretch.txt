= chstretch =

"""Stretches out animation on channels."""

:usage: `chstretch [-f <<start>> <<end>> | -t <<start>> <<end>>] [-v] -F <<nframes>> | -T <<nseconds>> <<channel_patterns>> `

Either the -F or -T option must be specified. If the -f and -t options
are not specified, the whole channel will be stretched.

NOTE:
    chstretch will push/pull segments that occur after the specified
    time range in order to add or subtract the requested time. To
    preserve the length of the channel an opposite stretch must be
    performed on another part of the channel. Alternatively, chkeymv can
    be used to do channel stretching.

NOTE:
    When specifying a frame range which begins and/or ends between
    integer frames, the segment in which the range boundary falls will
    be stretched.
