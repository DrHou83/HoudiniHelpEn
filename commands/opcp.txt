= opcp =

"""Copies an operator to a new place in the operator hierarchy."""

:usage: `opcp [-N] [-S] [-c] <<operator1>> [<<operator2>> ...] [<<destination>>]`

NOTE:
    If an operator with the same name exists at the destination, the
    copy will be renamed.

@options
    `-N`:
        Save any network boxes that match the names provided, without
        automatically saving their contents.
    `-S`:
        Same as -N option, but also saves each specified network box's
        contents. Will avoid duplicate saving of an operator if both the
        operator and its network box are specified by the names
        provided.
    `-c`:
        (Clone) Copies have their animatable parameters set to reference
        the original operator. You can override parameters by changing
        the channels manually after copying.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
