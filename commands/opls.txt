= opls =

"""Lists operators in the network hierarchy."""

:usage: `opls [-a] [-d] [-f] [-l] [-t] [-R] [<<operator_pattern>>]`

opls works like the ls command in UNIX. If you don't specify an
<<operator_pattern>>, it prints the operators in the current network
path.

If an operator contains other operators (for example, an object
containing SOPs or a subnetwork node), the number of operators inside
is printed in parentheses.



@options
    `-l`:
        Print in long format (show more information).

        The long format shows operator flags using the following
        symbols. If the flag is on, the symbol appears, if the flag is
        off a dash (-) appears in the symbol's place.

        d:
            Display
        r:
            Render
        t:
            Template
        l/L:
            l = Soft locked, L = Hard locked
        e/h:
            e = Exposed, h = Hidden.
        b:
            Bypassed
        c:
            Current
        s:
            Selected
    `-a`:
        Print all operators (includes hidden operators).
    `-d`:
        Do not print the contents of networks.
    `-f`:
        Print full paths.
    `-R`:
        For each network, recursively list its contents as well.
    `t`:
        Sort operators by their last modified time.
