= opscript =

"""Prints the commands necessary to recreate an operator."""

:usage: `opscript [-r] [-m <<in_wire>> <<out_wire>> | -g] [-o] [-n] [-P | -p] [-b] [[-v | -w] | [-c | -d]] [-s] [-G] [-C] [-N] [-S] [-f] <<name_pattern>> `

@options
    `-r`:
        Recursively apply to the entire operator hierarchy. The command will not output script for internal node creation in a locked asset, only the top level of the asset.
    `-m <<in_wire>> <<out_wire>> `:
        Print top-level arguments in macro form. The names will have to
        be specified when the results script is sourced. This option
        creates more general code than -g.

        <<in_wire>> and <<out_wire>> specify the input and output wire
        nodes.

    `-f`:
        When generating a script, use full paths (rather than relative
        paths) when descending to the lower level of the folder
        hierarchy, if a directory change is required in such a script.
    `-g`:
        Print top-level arguments in general form. The names will have
        to be specified when the results script is sourced.
    `-o`:
        Save outgoing wires as well.
    `-P`:
        Don't save spare parameters or channels. Also applies to child nodes.
    `-p`:
        Don't save spare parameters or channels on top level nodes. Spare
        parameters and channels on child nodes will be saved.
    `-n`:
        Do not output chblockbegin/chblockend commands. Normally the
        output encloses all chadd and chkey commands inside
        chblockbegin/chblockend commands for efficiency.
    `-b`:
        (Brief) Do not print values if they are the parameter's
        default.
    `-v`:
        Evaluate channel values, do not print channel information.
    `-w`:
        Same as the -v option, but only applies to the root node when
        recursing with the -r option.
    `-c`:
        Only output channels (overrides -v).
    `-d`:
        Same as the -c option, but only applies to the root node when
        recursing with the -r option.
    `-s`:
        Output channel and key times in samples (frames) instead of
        seconds.
    `-G`:
        Save the groups of each node also. Note that you must be working
        on a manager or subnet node to use this option, since only those
        kinds of nodes can store groups.
    `-C`:
        Generate a creation script for the operator. The script
        generated with this option is suitable as a creation script
        (i.e. the script run every time this type of operator is added).
        This option works in conjunction with the -v, -b, -c and -r
        options.
    `-N`:
        Script any network boxes that match <<name_pattern>>, without
        automatically scripting their contents.
    `-S`:
        Same as -N option, but also scripts each specified network box's
        contents. Will avoid duplicate scripting of an operator if both
        the operator and its network box are specified by
        <<name_pattern>>.
    `-V`:
	Omit outputting version information.
