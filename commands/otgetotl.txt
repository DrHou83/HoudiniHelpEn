"""Determines whether/where an operator type is defined."""

:usage: `otgetotl [-b] <<table>>/<<operator>> `

This command lets you determine if a given operator type is defined in
an operator type library, and if so, which library is currently being
used to provide the operator type. The output of this command is the
full path of the operator type library file that defines the operator.



@options
    `-b`:
        Print 1 if the type is defined by an operator type library,
        otherwise print 0.
