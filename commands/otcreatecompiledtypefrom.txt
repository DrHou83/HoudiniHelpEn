"""Creates a new operator type definition from a subnet."""

:usage: `otcreatecompiledtypefrom [-n <<op_name>>] [-N <<op_label>>] [-l <<hda_file>>] <<vop network>> `

This command serves the same purpose as the dialog that appears when you
choose the __Compile VEX to SHOP Type__ item from the RMB menu of a VOP network
node tile, such as Material Shader Builder SHOP or VEX Surface SHOP Type VOPNET.
The various options correspond to the controls in the mentioned dialog.

This command only works if the node specified by the <<vop network>> argument
is in fact a node that can generate code. 

This function uses the VOP network to generate VFL code and to compile it to
VEX, which is then stored in the digital asset section or sections. The digital
asset does not have contents section, which means it does not have VOP network
inside, but instead relies on the saved VEX sections to provide the shader code.

@options
    `-n <<op_name>> `:
        Internal name for the new operator type. The default value is
        the name of the subnet node, preceded by the current user name
        to help ensure the name is unique.
    `-N <<op_label>> `:
        Descriptive name for the new operator type. The default value is
        derived from the name of the subnet.
    `-l <<hda_file>> `:
        Name of the operator type library file where the new operator
        type should be saved. The default value is
        $HOME/houdini<<version>>/hda/OPcustom.hda.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    otcreatecompiledtypefrom -n mymaterial -N "My Material" -l $HOME/mylib.hda  /shop/vopmaterial1
    }}}
    Creates a new operator type called mymaterial in `$HOME/mylib`. It will be a
    scripted operator with code saved in the asset sections.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    otcreatecompiledtypefrom -n myshader -N "My Shader" -l $HOME/mylib.hda  /vex/vopnet_surface1
    }}}
    Creates a new operator type called myshader in `$HOME/mylib.hda`. It is a
    surface shader operator with vex code already compiled and saved within the
    digital asset definition.
