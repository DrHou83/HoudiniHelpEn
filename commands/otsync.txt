= otsync =

"""Syncs the contents of nodes with the contents of their type
definitions."""

:usage: `otsync [-d | -u] <<pattern>>`

For subnet types that were saved with their contents locked (see otedit
and otwrite), you can use this command to replace the contents of
operators matching <<pattern>> with the contents of the operator type.
The parameters of the node are not modified, only the contents.

See [editing digital assets|/assets/edit]  for more information.



@options
    `-d`:
        Prints the current synchronization status of the given
        operators.
    `-u`:
        (Unsync) If the nodes specified by the pattern match the locked
        contents of their operator type definitions, unlock the nodes so
        you can edit their contents. This does not modify the contained
        nodes.
