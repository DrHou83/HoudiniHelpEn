"""Shows all/missing external references in a node."""

:usage: `opextern [-g] [-l] [-m] [-M] [-n] [-q] [-r] [-R] <<node>> [<<node2>> ...]`

@options
    `-g`:
        Group frame ranges together; files like `butterfly$F.pic` will be
        shown as `bufferfly$F.pic [1-7]`.
    `-l`:
        References that are effectively locked within the network are
        not considered external references. This flag relaxes the check
        for locks within subnets so that subnet branches that are not
        displayed are ignored.
    `-m`:
        Check each file to see if it exists. Missing files are printed
        with '(missing)'.
    `-M`:
        Check each file to see if it exists, and only show the missing
        files.
    `-n`:
        Show only the nodes which have external references (or have
        missing external references, if -M is specified).
    `-q`:
        (Quiet) Do not print messages like 'No external references
        found'. Useful in scripts.
    `-r`:
        Show only the external references themselves (don't print the
        node referencing them). If -M is specified, this will show only
        missing external references.
    `-R`:
        Recurse into networks and subnets.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opextern geo1
    }}}
    show all external refs on geo1 object

    {{{
    #!hscript
    opextern -R geo1
    }}}
    show all external refs in geo1

    {{{
    #!hscript
    opextern -RMr geo1
    }}}
    show all missing external refs in geo1

    {{{
    #!hscript
    opextern -gR /
    }}}
    show all external refs in the current session grouped by frame range
    if animated.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    opextern -nR /
    }}}
    show all nodes in the current session with external references.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    opextern -rR /
    }}}
    show all external references in the current session.
