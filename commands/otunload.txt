"""Unloads an operator type library."""

:usage: `otunload [-n] <<otl_file>> [<<source>>]`

The <<otl_file>> argument specifies the type library to unload.

The same library may be listed in multiple "OPlibraries" files, in which
case you can specify the <<source>> from which to remove the library.

If you do not give a <<source>>, the command finds the source that was
used to load the library, and removes the library name from that
location.



@options
    `-n`:
        Do not try to modify the OPlibraries file. This argument is
        useful when the OPlibraries file contains wild cards, and you
        are about to delete the OTL file that is being unloaded. The
        contents of the OPlibraries file are not disturbed, but it
        becomes safe to delete the OTL file because Houdini will no
        longer be using it.
