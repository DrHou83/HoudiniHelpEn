= closeport =

"""Closes a communication port created by the openport command."""

:usage: `closeport [-i] <<port_number>> `

@options
    `-i`:
        Close the port immediately, rather than closing it with a
        message on the even queue. This option is used internally by
        Houdini, you should have no need to use it.
