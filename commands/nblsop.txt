"""Lists operators contained in network boxes"""

:usage: `nblsop [-a] [-f] [-l] [-o] [-q] [-t] <<name_pattern>> `

Lists all operators contained within the network boxes specified by
'name_pattern'.



@options
    `-a`:
        List all operators in a network box (including hidden ones)
    `-f`:
        Print full paths
    `-i`:
        Also list any subnet indirect inputs found within the network
        boxes. These will always be listed after the operators in each
        network box.
    `-l`:
        Print operator information in long format

        The long format lists many flags for operators. A hyphen (-) is
        printed if the flag is not active.

        d:
            Display
        r:
            Render
        t:
            Template
        l/L:
            Locked (soft-locked/hard-locked)
        e/h:
            Exposed or hidden
        b:
            Bypassed
        c:
            Current
        s:
            Selected
        If the node contains other operators, the number of operators it
        contains will be printed in parentheses. For example, an object
        containing SOPs or a subnetwork.

    `-o`:
        Omit network box names
    `-q`:
        Prevent error message from being printed
    `-v`:
        Sort operators in each network box by last modified time
