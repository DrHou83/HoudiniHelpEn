""" Removes data from a DOP object when running a [Script Solver
DOP|Node:dop/scriptsolver]. """

:usage: `dopsolveremovedata <<object_index>> <<dataname>> `

This is one of a set of commands for use by the [Script Solver
DOP|Node:dop/scriptsolver]. Calling this command will generate an error
if a script solver is not currently solving for objects.

Removes DOP data from the object specified by object_index. Note that
this object index is not the DOP object identifier, but an index into
the array of objects being solved by the current script solver.

The dataname can contain slashes to remove subdata attached to other
data on the object.
