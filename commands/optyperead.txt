"""Loads an .optype archive and installs the contained type into a
Houdini directory."""

:usage: `optyperead <<src_file>>.op_type <<install_dir>> `

.optype archives describe the user configurable aspects of operators.
For built in operators, this includes the label, icon, default
parameters, and help text. For HDK created operators it also includes
the .so. For Vex and Subnet operators it includes the parameters and
script which defines their behavior.

The install directory should be in the HOUDINI_PATH.
