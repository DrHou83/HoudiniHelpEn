"""Splits an operator type library into component files."""

:usage: `otexpand <<otl_file>> <<to_dir>> `

This command writes out the contents of <<otl_file>> as individual files
and an index file in <<to_dir>>. If <<to_dir>> does not exist, the
command will create it.

The combination of otexpand and otcollapse lets you extract component
files from an OTL with otexpand, edit them, then rebuild the OTL with
otcollapse.
