"""Creates a new take."""

:usage: `takeadd [-i] [-v] [-c] [-p <<parent_take>>] [<<name>>]`

@options
    `-i`:
        Insert the take between the parent and its child takes (becomes
        the new parent of the child takes).
    `-v`:
        Verbose: print the name of the take created.
    `-c`:
        Change to the new take after it is created.
    `-p <<parent_take>> `:
        The parent of the new take. If you do not specify a parent, the
        new take becomes a child of the current take.
    ` <<name>> `:
        Short name for the take. This name cannot contain spaces. If you
        do not specify a name, Houdini will create a generic name from
        the default basename and a number (for example, "take5"). You
        can rename a take, or set the default basename, with the
        takename command.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    takeadd -c -i -p hip
    }}}
    Inserts a take between the hip take and all its children, and
    automatically switch to that take.
