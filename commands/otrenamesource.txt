= otrenamesource =

"""Gives a descriptive name to a library source."""

:usage: `otrenamesource <<source>> <<new_name>> `

The descriptive name can be used with any commands that accept a source
argument.

For example, you might want to name the source in your HOME directory as
"My Libraries". The source in $HFS/houdini is "Standard Libraries".

This name is stored in the OPlibraries file at the specified location.
