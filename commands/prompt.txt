#type: hscript

= prompt =

"""Change the textport prompt string."""

:usage: `prompt <<new_prompt>> `

The prompt string is expanded each time it is printed, so you can
include variables such as the frame number, and backtick commands.



@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    prompt '$F `execute(oppwd)`:'
    }}}
    Sets the prompt to the current frame number, followed by the current
    OP working directory.
