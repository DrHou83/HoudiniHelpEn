"""Extracts a file from inside an operator type definition."""

:usage: `otcontentsave [-l <<source_otl>>] [-o <<file_name>>] <<table>>/<<operator>> <<section>> `

The <<table>> value specifies the class of the operator you want to
modify. A list of valid table names is found in the help for the otwrite
command. The <<operator>> value is the name of the specific operator
type.

The <<section>> name is the name of the data to save. Use the -o option
to specify the name of the file to save the data to.

To get a list of all data sections that exist in an operator definition,
use the otcontentls command..

@options
    `-l <<source_otl>> `:
        The library in which to find the operator type. If you don't
        specify a <<source_otl>>, the command uses the current
        definition for the operator.
    `-o <<file_name>> `:
        The name of the file to save the data to.
