"""Populates a channel group with a node's channels."""

:usage: `chgpopulate [-c] [-f] [-g <<group_name>>] [-l] <<node_path>> `

Use this command to populate a channel group with a node's channels.
This command also allows you to create nested channel groups
corresponding to parameter folders.



@options
    `-g <<group_name>> `:
        An optional group name can be specified. If this option is not
        specified the group name will be derived from the node name. If
        the group already exists, any channels or subgroups will be
        added to it.
    `-c`:
        Add only parameters with live channels.
    `-u`:
        Add only unlocked parameters.
    `-f`:
        Create nested channel groups from parameter folders.
    `-l`:
        Only create channels in groups without child groups. Groups with
        child groups and channels will be modified to include an
        additional child group with the parent's channels.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    chgpopulate -c /obj/model
    }}}
    Create a channel group called <<model>> and add parameters with
    channels to it.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    chgpopulate -f /obj/model
    }}}
    Create a channel group called <<model>>, create subgroups derived
    from the names of <<model>>'s parameter folders and add the channels
    to their corresponding groups.
