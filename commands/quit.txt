"""Exits Houdini."""

:usage: `quit [-f] [<<exit_status>>]`

You can set an exit status code that may be useful to the process that
started Houdini. For example, you may start Houdini from a shell script
and branch execution after Houdini quits based on its exit status. By
convention, a non-zero exit status often signals an error. The default
exit status is 0.



@options
    `-f`:
        (Force) Exit immediately without prompting to save.
