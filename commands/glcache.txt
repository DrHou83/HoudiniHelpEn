:usage: `glcache [-c] [-C] [-t <<texcachesize>>] [-v <<bufcachesize>]`

There are two OpenGL caches, one for textures and the other for vertex buffers
(geometry). 

@options
    `-c`:
        Clear the texture cache. This will also reload textures files that 
        are out of date.

    `-C`:
        Clear the buffer cache of unused buffers, keeping buffers which are
        still actively used by any open viewports.

    `-m`:
	Print the maximum texture and buffer cache sizes, in MB.

    `-s`:
	Print the current texture and buffer cache sizes, in MB.

    `-t`:
        Set the texture cache size to 'texcachesize', in MB.

    `-v`:
        Set the vertex buffer cache size to 'bufcachesize', in MB.
