:usage: `unitmass [<<new_unit_mass>>]`

If no parameters are specified to this command, it outputs the current
Unit Mass value. This is the same value that appears in the Hip File Options 
page of the Houdini Preferences dialog. A number can also be supplied as a
parameter which changes the Unit Mass value. The number is interpreted
as a mass in kilograms.
