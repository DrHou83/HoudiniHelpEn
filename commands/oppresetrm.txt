"""Removes a preset."""

:usage: `oppresetrm <<op_name>> <<preset_name>> [<<directory>>]`
:usage: `oppresetrm -t <<table/operator>> <<preset_name>> [<<directory>>]`

The first argument is the name of an operator of the type for which you
want to remove the preset. The second argument is the preset label.

You can specify a disk <<directory>> from which the preset should be
deleted. If you do not specify a directory, the command deletes the
preset from the location where it is currently defined.

If you do not supply any arguments, the command lists all valid
directory names.

This command can be invoked with either a node name or an operator table
and type name (if the -t option is specified). The table value specifies
the class of the operator you want to modify. A list of valid table
names can be found in the help for the otwrite command. The operator
value is the name of the specific operator type.
