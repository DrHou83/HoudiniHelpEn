"""Lists operator types defined in a library file."""

:usage: `otls [-f <<format>>] [<<hda_file>> [<<table>>/<<operator>>]]`
:usage: `otls -a <<table>>/<<operator>> `

Without any arguments, the command prints a list of currently installed
operator type libraries.

If you give a <<hda_file>>, the command lists the operator types defined
in the library file.

If you give an <<hda_file>> and a <<table>>/<<operator>> pair, the
command prints information about the given operator type in the library
file. The <<table>> value specifies the class of the operator you want
to modify. A list of valid table names is found in the help for the
otwrite command. The <<operator>> value is the name of the specific
operator type.

If both an OTL file name and a <<table>>/<<operator>> are specified,
this command also accepts the -f option.



@options
    `-f <<format>> `:
        Allows the command output to be customized. The <<format>>
        argument is a string where each letter represents a particular
        piece of information. The accepted letters are:

        * n - Operator type name.

        * l - Descriptive label.

        * p - Path to the type definition.

        * c - Icon for the operator type.

        * t - Operator class (such as Object, Sop, etc.).

        * x - Extra info which depends on the operator type.

        * i - Minimum number of allowed inputs.

        * I - Maximum number of allowed inputs.

        * s - Specified if the operator type is a subnet.

        * d - Specified if the operator type is a dummy definition.

        * m - Modification time for the type definition.

        * u - User specified arbitrary info.

    `-a`:
        Outputs a list of all OTL files currently installed which
        contain a definition for the specified operator type. Use
        `otgetotl` to find out which definition is currently in use.

@examples
    {{{
