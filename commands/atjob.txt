"""Execute commands at a future time."""

:usage: `atjob [-p] <<seconds>> <<command>> `
:usage: `atjob -l`
:usage: `atjob -r <<id>> [<<id2>> ...]`
:usage: `atjob -r all`

atjob schedules a command to be run <<n>> number of seconds from now, or
every <<n>> seconds.

NOTE:
    Jobs only work correctly inside graphical applications.

NOTE:
    The job runs at the application's first opportunity. If the
    application is very busy (for example, rendering), the job is not
    guaranteed to run on time.



@options
    `-p`:
        Periodic: run the command repeatedly at the given interval.
    `-l`:
        Print all pending jobs.
    `-r <<id>> [<<id2>> ...]`:
        Remove a pending job (prevent it from running). You can specify
        the ID of a pending job.
    `-r all`:
        Remove all pending jobs.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    atjob 300 mwrite -i
    }}}
    Run "write -i" in 300 seconds (5 minutes).

    {{{
    #!hscript
    atjob -p 10 mwrite -i
    }}}
    Run "mwrite -i" every 10 seconds.
