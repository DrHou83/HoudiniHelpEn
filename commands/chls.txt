"""Lists channels."""

:usage: `chls [-l[v]|[-q]|a] [<<pattern>>]`

You can specify a node or channel path pattern to list sets of channels.
If no pattern is given, the command lists the current node's channels.



@options
    `-l`:
        List keys also.
    `-v`:
        Verbose listing of keys.
    `-a`:
        List all channels (including non-animated channels). If this
        option is not specified, only animated channels are listed. You
        cannot use this option with a path pattern.
    `-q`:
        Suppress extra information when using -a.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    chls -l geo*/*
    }}}
    
    {{{
    #!hscript
    chls -a geo*
    }}}
