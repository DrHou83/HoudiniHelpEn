"""Writes images from a Composite View or MPlay to disk"""

:usage: `imgview [options] <<output_files>> [<<view_name>>]

This command provides a simple way to write images to disk from a Composite View, Render View, or MPlay session. When more that one viewport is present in a viewer, the images in the active viewport are written. If the <<view_name>> is omitted, all Composite and Render viewers will be written.

         Render frames from <<start>> to <<end>>, inclusive.
    `-i <<step>>`:
         Render every <<step>> frame.
    `-g auto|off`:
         Turn colorspace conversion on (<<auto>>) or <<off>>. 
    `-p <<planes>>`:
         The list of planes to write from the images.
    `-r <<scale_width>> <<scale_height>>`:
         Scale the image before writing.
