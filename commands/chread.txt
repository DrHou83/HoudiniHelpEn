"""Reads channel data from a file."""

:usage: `chread [-f <<fstart>> <<fend>> | -o <<fstart>> | -n] <<parameter_name_patterns>> <<chan_or_bchan_filename>>`
:usage: `chread [-f <<fstart>> <<fend>> | -o <<fstart>> | -n] [-r <<src_pat>> <<dest_pat>>] <<chn_or_bchn_filename>>`
:usage: `chread -i [-s] <<filename>>`

* If the filename ends in `.chan` or `.bchan`:

  The specified file is assumed to be a raw channel data file and column
  data from the file will be read and matched with the parameters listed
  in the order specified. For non-animated parameters, new channels will
  be created as needed.

  The -f option gives the frame range to load the data into. Raw data will
  be scaled if the frame range is greater than the number of available 
  data frames. Otherwise, no scaling will occur.

  Unlike the `-f` option, the `-o` option simply gives the starting frame for
  loading the data (no scaling will be done).

  If the `-f` and `-o` options are omitted, loading will start at
  the global animation start time.

  If the `-n` option is specified, any previous animation on a channel will
  be deleted before loading.

* If the filename ends in `.chn` or `.bchn`:

  The specified file is assumed to be a keyframe data channel file and
  loaded into the current hip file.

  The `-f` option gives the frame range to load the data into. Keys will
  be scaled into the frame range if the file's range does not match.

  The `-o` option gives the starting frame to load the data into 
  (no scaling will be done).

  If the `-f` and `-o` options are omitted, then the file's frame range is
  used.

  If there are existing channels, then any animation outside the frame
  range will be preserved with keys set at the beginning and end of the
  frame range. If the `-n` option is specified, then any previous
  animation will be deleted first.

  The `-r` option allows renaming of channel node paths before the
  channels are loaded from file. In the `chwrite` command, full paths of
  the nodes are saved out. This option allows the mapping of animation
  from one set of nodes into a different set. This renaming function
  will rename nodes from the data file in the same manner as how the
  Rename CHOP functions.

  For any nodes that do not match the `src_pat` (source pattern), then
  will be loaded into their original path. Note that if the destination
  node is not found, then loading will stop.

* If you specify the `-i` option:

  The command takes specified file (`.chn`, `.bchn`, `.chan`, or `.bchan` extension) 
  and gives information regarding the file. This option is similar in
  output to the command line `chinfo` program. If the optional `-s` flag is
  given, the command skips the per segment information.

NOTE:
    This command is _not_ undoable.
