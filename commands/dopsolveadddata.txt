""" Adds data to a DOP object when running a [Script Solver
DOP|Node:dop/scriptsolver]. """

:usage: `dopsolveadddata [-a] [-e] [-u] [-v] [-c sourcedataname] <<object_index>> <<dataname>> <<datatype>> `

This is one of a set of commands for use by the [Script Solver
DOP|Node:dop/scriptsolver]. Calling this command will generate an error
if a script solver is not currently solving for objects.

Creates new DOP data on the object specified by object_index. Note that
this object index is not the DOP object identifier, but an index into
the array of objects being solved by the current script solver.

The dataname can contain slashes to create subdata on existing data.
The datatype can be any of the available DOP data types returned by the
[dopdatatypes|Cmd:dopdatatypes] command.

@options
    `-a`:
        Attempt to adopt existing data with the same name if it is of a
        different data type than the one being added, or if the -e
        option is not specified.
    `-e`:
        If data with the same name and data type as the requested data
        already exists, leave that data untouched.
    `-u`:
        Uses the specified data name as a base from which to create a
        unique data name that does not conflict with any existing data.
    `-v`:
        Output the name of the newly created data. This option is most
        useful in conjunction with the -u option to find out the new
        unique data name, but can be used without it.
    `-c sourcedataname`:
        Once the new data is created, it is set equal to the data
        specified by sourcedataname. The source data does not need to be
        the same data type as the newly created data, however it will
        usually be the same or a similar data type. For example,
        [Position|Node:dop/position] data can be meaningfully used as
        the source for [RBD State|Node:dop/rbdstate] data or vice versa.
