"""Changes global options of a COP/Mplay image viewer."""

:usage: `imgview [options] <<view_name>> `

The Mplay and COPs image viewer interface can be scripted through the
use of the commands imgview, imgview2d, imgviewhist and imgviewtime.
This command affects the interface common to all three viewer types. The
other commands affect controls specific to the viewer types.

NOTE:
    Image viewer names are always of the pattern imgview<<N>> where
    <<N>> = 1,2,3... (e.g. imgview1).
