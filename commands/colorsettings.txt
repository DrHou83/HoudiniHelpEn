"""Changes the gamma and/or LUT on various UI gadgets."""

:usage: `colorsettings [-A] [-R] [-g gamma] [-l lut] [-c] [-f] [-i] [-p] [-r] [-s] [-v]`

This command changes the LUT and gamma settings on various Houdini views
and tools. There is one global LUT and gamma setting which the tools and views
can share.

To select a viewer or tool to modify, use one or more of the flags: -c, -f, -i,
-p, -r, -s or -v.

If no tool or viewer is selected, -g and -l can be used with -D to set the 
global gamma and LUT without changing any of the viewers' settings.

The -A applies the current global LUT and gamma to the selected viewers 
or tools. -R is used to remove the LUT and gamma from the selected viewers 
or tools (reset to 1 and no LUT); it cannot be used with -A, -g or -l.

If no changes are applied, the current LUT and gamma settings for the given 
tool or viewer is displayed.


@options
    `-A`:
        Apply the current global LUT and gamma to the listed tools and viewers.
    `-R`:
        Remove the current global LUT and gamma from the listed tools and 
	viewers.
    `-D`:
        Make the specified gamma the global default (if -g is specified) and/or
	the specified LUT the global default (if -l is specified). -D can be 
	used with the selection flags to set both the global defaults and the 
	viewers' settings at the same time.
    `-g <<gam>> `:
        Use gamma <<gam>> for the gamma setting 
    `-l <<lutfile>> `:
        Use the LUT (lookup table) to <<lutfile>>
    `-p`:
        Selects Color Pickers and Swatches.
    `-c`:
        Selects the Composite and Render views.
    `-s`:
        Selects the COP Save Image... dialog.
    `-v`:
        Selects the 3D Viewport.
    `-f`:
        Selects the 3D Flipbook.
    `-r`:
        Selects the Render Region tool.
    `-i`:
        Selects the IP device.
        All interactive renders through this device have those gamma/LUT
        settings applied in Mplay. If the gamma is set to 0 for ip, then
        no gamma override will occur; whatever gamma MPlay starts with
        (or is currently using) will be used.
