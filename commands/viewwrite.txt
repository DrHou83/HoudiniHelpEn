= viewwrite =

"""Creates a flipbook from a viewport."""

:usage: `viewwrite [options] <<viewername>> [<<output_files>>] `

<<viewername>> must be a single, open viewport.

<<output_files>> is a file path (using the $F variable to create an image
sequence). If `-M` is used with files in <<output_files>>, frames are written to MPlay and disk files simultaneously.

@options

`-f <<start>> <<end>> `:
    Frame range to render
`-i <<inc>> `:
    Increment in frame range. For example, 2 renders every other
    frame, 3 renders every third frame, etc.
`-E`:
    Leave the playbar at the last frame rendered instead of restoring the playbar frame prior to the flipbook. 
`-r <<resx>> <<resy>> `:
    Resolution. If not specified, the command uses the viewport
    resolution. The command makes no effort to preserve aspect
    ratio.
`-R current|beauty|all`
    The render target to flipbook.

    current:
       The currently selected viewport.
    beauty:
       The beauty pass of the selected viewport, which excludes backgrounds, handles, grids, and decorations.
    all:
       Render all viewports in the scene view to a single image.

`-c`:
    Crop out view mask overlay region.
`-b <<imagefile>>`:
    Background image sent to MPlay. This has no effect on output files.
`-B`:
    Only flipbook the beauty pass. Ignore handles, guides, and decorations. This option is deprecated, use `-R beauty` instead.
`-g <<gamma>>`:
    Gamma value.
`-l <<lutfile>>`:
    File containing a lookup table (LUT).
`-e`:
    Enable block editing.
`-a <<audio_file>> `:
    Audio file to use with the flipbook.
`-o <<frame>> <<audio_sec>> `:
    Synchronize image <<frame>> with audio at <<audio_sec>>.
`-q <<aa_quality>> `:
    Set the antialias quality to 0 (off), 1 (low, 2x), 2 (med, 4x)
    or 3 (high, 8x or 6x). This will antialias polygons and textures
    in addition to lines.
`-S <<session_label>> `:
    Sets the flipbook session label, so that flipbook images will be routed
    to the flipbook with that label. If no flipbook exists with that label,
    once will be started.
`-v <<pattern>> `:
    Only objects whose names match <<pattern>> appear in the render.
    Default is "*".
`-t visible|geo|not_geo|all`
    Restrict object types displayed.

    visible:
        All currently visible object types.
    geo:
        Only geometry objects.
    not_geo:
        All currently visible object types except for geometry objects.
    all:
        All object types, even if not currently visible.

`-M`:
    Flipbook to MPlay in addition to any files specificed.
`-m <<frames>> <<bias>> <<shutter>> `:
    Flipbook with motion blur, by blending <<num_frames>> subframes
    together. <<bias>> specifies if the subframes rendered are
    before (-1), centered about (0) or after (1) the specified
    render frame. <<shutter>> specifies the camera shutter time (or,
    the portion of a frame that the subframes are sampled over). If
    zero, the value from the camera attached to the viewport will be
    used.
`-d <<quality>> <<focus_length>> <<aperture>> <<fstop>> `:
    Flipbook with depth of field, by blending <<quality>> subframes
    together, jittered about the camera's circle of confusion.
    Increasing the quality improves the blur, at the expense of
    rendering time. The <<focus_length>>, <<aperture>> and <<fstop>>
    parameters specify the camera values needed to determine the
    depth of field (defaults 10, 41.4124 and 22). If any of these
    parameters are zero, the value from the camera attached to the
    viewport will be used.
`-k`:
    Render only frames at which currently scoped channels have
    keys.
`-A`:
    Append the rendered frames to the existing sequence (frame
    numbers will no longer correspond to the images).
`-I`:
    Initialize simulation operators (POPs, DOPs, Spring SOPs) before
    creating the flipbook. This is useful to flipbook simulations
    that are not cached, and therefore may not appear correctly in
    the flipbook if the current frame is later than the frames being
    flipbooked.

@examples

{{{
#!hscript
viewwrite -M -f 1 10 Build.panetab1.world.persp1
}}}
Render frames 1 to 10 to a flipbook.

{{{
#!hscript
viewwrite -f 1 10 Build.panetab1.world.persp1 '$F.jpg'
}}}
Render frames 1 to 10 to disk files. Single quotes protect the $F
variable from being expanded when the command is entered.
