"""Lists operator types matching a pattern."""

:usage: `otglob [-o] [-l <<hda_file>>] <<table>>/<<operator>> [<<table>>/<<operator>> ...]`

Lists all operator types that match the specified table and operator
name patterns. Any number of table/operator patterns can be listed, and
each one can contain the standard set of wild card characters (`*`, `?`,
`[xyz]`) in either the table or operator portion. However there must
always be a slash to separate the table and operator parts.

@options
    `-o`:
        List only operator types that are defined as digital assets
        inside an operator type library. Without this option, built-in
        operator types such as the Point SOP of Source POP will also be
        listed.

    `-l <<hda_file>> `:
        List only operator types that are found in the specified
        operator type library file.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    otglob -l $HH/hda/OPlibShopVMantra.hda Shop/v_*
    }}}
    Will output a list of all SHOPs with names that start with `v_` in
    the OTL file `$HH/hda/OPlibShopVMantra.hda`.
