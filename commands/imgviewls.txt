:usage: `imgviewls [options]`

Image viewer names are always of the pattern `imgview<<N>>` (for example
`imgview1`).

This command is mainly useful in combination with commands such as
[imgview|Cmd:imgview], which lets you manipulate image viewer settings,
and [imgviewtool|Cmd:imgviewtool].

If one of `-c` or `-r` is given, `imgviewls` will only list Composite Views or 
Render Views. If none or both are given, all image viewers are listed.

@options
    `-c`:
        List Composite Views.
    `-r`:
        List Render Views.
