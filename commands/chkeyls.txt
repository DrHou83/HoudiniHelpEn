Lists key times for specific channels that are within ranges or at
frames. If no ranges or times are given, then the entire channel range
is taken as the range.

NOTE:
    Partial key information options can be used together.



@options
    `-q`:
        Quite mode. Don't report any errors.
    `-e`:
        Only display the times at either end of the range.
    `-t`:
        Times are specified in seconds, instead of frames (frames are
        the default), and the values returned are in seconds instead of
        frames.
    `-s`:
        Prints out hscript "chkey" commands instead of key times.
    `-S`:
        Same as -s, except the chkey commands do not omit, which might
        make the output easier to parse.
    `-v`:
        Print partial key information: the value entering the key.
    `-V`:
        Print partial key information: the value leaving the key.
    `-m`:
        Print partial key information: the slope entering the key.
    `-M`:
        Print partial key information: the slope leaving the key.
    `-a`:
        Print partial key information: the acceleration entering the
        key.
    `-A`:
        Print partial key information: the acceleration leaving the
        key.
    `-f`:
        Print partial key information: the frame of each key. Time is
        used if -f is combined with -t. This is the default.
