"""Sets the global image viewer display options."""

:usage: `imgdispopt [options]`

The image viewer display options for MPlay and COPs are global to all
viewers. This command allows you to set any or all of these options.



@options
    `-m <<mem>> `:
        Sets the memory usage of the viewer to <<mem>> Mb. Allocating
        more memory will allow more images to be cached, which speeds up
        playback.
    `-P on|off`:
        Pop Window when Rendering. If on, the MPlay window is popped on
        top of other windows when a new image arrives.
    `-M on|off`:
        Mipmap images. If on, images will be mipmapped when zoomed out.
        This decreases the rendering artifacts by blurring the image
        slightly.
    `-A on|off`:
        Fast Aspect Ratio. If on, the image is scaled horizontally in
        hardware by the aspect ratio. However, in cases, this can cause
        noticeable scaling artifacts. If off, the image is scaled in
        software using a better box filter. This reduces these
        artifacts, but is slightly slower. This option is only useful if
        images are displayed with a pixel aspect ratio other than 1.
    `-g <<gamma>> `:
        Sets the default viewport gamma, which the gamma value that will
        be set if the user presses 'reset gamma'.
    `-G <<gamma_scope>> `:
        Determines which planes the gamma is applied to, normally just
        the color (C) plane.
    `-B <<bg_gamma>> `:
        Sets the gamma value applied to the background color.
    `-v single|split`:
        Setup the viewport layout in single or split mode. In single
        mode, one viewport is shown regardless of how many sources are
        displayed, and a strip along the bottom of the viewport allows
        for quick toggling between them. In split mode, one viewport is
        used for each source, up to the maximum viewport layout (see
        below).
    `-V <<cols>> <<rows>> `:
        Sets the viewport layout for split viewport mode. The maximum
        layout in any direction is 4.
    `-d h|v`:
        Sets the preferred layout direction for split mode. If set to
        'h' (horizontal), the viewports will start increasing in the
        horizontal direction before adding new rows. If set to 'v'
        (vertical), new viewports will be added vertically before adding
        new columns.
    `-a on|off`:
        Normally viewports are only shown if needed. If this option is
        turned on, then the full viewport layout specified by -V will
        always be shown, regardless of whether they are filled or not.
    `-i <<info>> `:
        Sets the viewport label info level. 0 is minimal (name only),
        and 3 is full image details. 1 and 2 give medium amounts of
        image details.
    `-b <<r>> <<g>> <<b>> `:
        Sets the background color of the viewport.
    `-o <<guide_file>> `:
        Sets the vector guide file to be drawn over top of the images.
    `-h on|off`:
        Turns handle alpha blending on or off.
    `-H on|off`:
        Turns handle anti-aliasing on or off.
    `-c <<r>> <<g>> <<b>> `:
        Sets the default handle color.
    `-C <<r>> <<g>> <<b>> `:
        Sets the located (highlighted) handle color.
    `-S <<r>> <<g>> <<b>> `:
        Sets the selected handle color.
    `-R <<radius>> `:
        Sets the handle pick radius (default 6 pixels)
    `-F d|dc|c`:
        Sets the viewport follow mode to Display Only (d), Display
        Image/Current node state (dc) or Current node only (c).
    `-D <<lut_file>> `:
        Sets the default display LUT for all viewers.
    `-I <<lut_file>> `:
        Sets the inspection LUT for all viewers. In the inspect window,
        an entry 'lut' will show the reverse lookup through the LUT,
        which is useful for Cineon images (to see the original Cineon
        numbers). 3D LUTs cannot be used as inspection LUTs.
    `-f <<bg_image>> `:
        Sets the background image (or image sequence).
    `-s on|off`:
        Turns the background image size override on or off. If on, the
        -r flag specifies the size that the background image should be
        displayed at.
    `-r <<xres>> <<yres>> `:
        Specifies the size that the background image should be scaled
        to. Only has an effect if '-s on' is also specified.
    `-p on|off`:
        Premultiplied Foreground Image. If on, this indicates that the
        foreground image is already a premultiplied image, and no alpha
        multiplication is required. If off, the image blending
        multiplies the foreground image by its alpha.
