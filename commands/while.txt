= while =

"""Loops through a block of commands while a condition is true."""

:usage: `while (<<condition>>) ... end`

The while statement tests <<condition>> and if it's true, loops over the
instructions between the while and end statements, then repeats.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    set i = 0
    while ( $i < 10 )
        set i = `$i+1`
        echo $i
    end
    }}}
