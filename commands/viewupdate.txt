"""Controls the updating of views."""

:usage: `viewupdate [-c] [-u never|changes|always|now]`

This command controls how often views update. Normally the views update
continuously, however you can improve script performance by disabling
updates while you change the world, then re-enabling updates to show
your changes all at once.

If you don't specify any options the command prints the current update
mode.

NOTE:
    Currently the update mode applies only to 3D viewports.



@options
    `-c`:
        Print output in the form of a command.
    `-u never|changes|always|now`:
        Sets the global view update policy:

        never (or "off"):
            Do not update views unless you do viewupdate -u now.
        changes (or "on"):
            Update views after changes.
        always (or "continuous"):
            Update continuously.
        now:
            Forces an update when the current update mode is "never".
