"""Turns profiling of VEX functions on/off"""

:usage: `vexprofile [-n] [-a] [-s] [-p] [-c] [-h] [-S] [start]`

Running the command with the word "start" after the options (if any)
start profiling. If you don't specify any flags, profiling is turned on
for all functions.

Running the command again without arguments and without the word "start"
turns profiling off. The command prints the profiling statistics when
you turn off profiling. So, to save the results, redirect the output
when you turn profiling off.



@options
    `-n`:
        (Numbers) Checks that all input and output variables are valid
        floating point numbers.

        Certain operations on invalid arguments can result in a value of
        "NAN" ("not a number"). This check will warn you about
        occurrences of this in your VEX code.

    `-a`:
        Profile all loaded functions.
    `-s`:
        Profile surface (SOP) functions.
    `-p`:
        Profile particle (POP) functions.
    `-c`:
        Profile compositing (COP) functions.
    `-h`:
        Profile channel (CHOP) functions.
    `-x`:
        Profile CVEX functions.
    `-S`:
        Profile shading functions.
