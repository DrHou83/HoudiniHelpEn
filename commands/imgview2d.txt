= imgview2d =

"""Changes options of a 2D view of a COP image viewer."""

:usage: `imgview2d [options] <<view_name>> [<<viewport_index>>]`

If viewport_index is specified, only that viewport is affected (1-16).
If it is not specified, or 'all' is specified, all viewports are
affected.

The imgview command also affects the more global settings of this type
of image viewer.

NOTE:
    Image viewer names are always of the pattern imgview<<N>> where
    <<N>> = 1,2,3... (e.g. imgview1).
