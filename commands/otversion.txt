= otversion =

"""Gets/sets the version of an operator type definition."""

:usage: `otversion <<table>>/<<operator>> `
:usage: `otversion -d <<table>>/<<operator>> `
:usage: `otversion <<table>>/<<operator>> <<version>> `

If you give a <<table>>/<<operator>> pair, the command prints the
operator type definition version.

If you give a <<table>>/<<operator>> pair and a version, the command
sets the operator type definition version.

The <<table>> value specifies the class of the operator you want to
modify. A list of valid table names is found in the help for the otwrite
command. The <<operator>> value is the name of the specific operator
type.

It is up to you how you use this version information; it is passed to the
SyncNodeVersion event handler script for performing parameter upgrades.

@options
    `-d`:
        Clear the operator type version.
