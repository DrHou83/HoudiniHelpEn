"""Helps determine what Operator Type Libraries are in a given Hip
file."""

:usage: `otinuse [-n] [-t] [-l] [-f <<otlfile>>] [<<rootnode>>]`

Also helps determine which operator types are within OTLs. At least one
of -n, -t, and -l must be specified. If more than one is set, the data
is output with the node name first, then the operator type, then the OTL
file name.

The <<rootnode>> parameter indicates where Houdini should start
searching for eligible nodes. The search is performed recursively. If a
<<rootnode>> is not set, the entire Hip file is searched.



@options
    `-n`:
        Specifies that the names of any nodes matching the search should
        be output.
    `-t`:
        Indicates the operator type should be output.
    `-l`:
        Indicates that the OTL file name should be output for all
        matching nodes.
    `-f <<otlfile>> `:
        If -f is specified, only nodes defined by operator types in that
        OTL file will be output. If -f is not given, any operator
        defined by any OTL will be listed.
