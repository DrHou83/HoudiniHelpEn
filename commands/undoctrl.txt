= undoctrl =

"""Turns undo on or off, or clears undo memory."""

:usage: `undoctrl on|off`
:usage: `undoctrl [-s] [-c]`

Turning off the undo mechanism can cause scripts to execute with greater
speed, but the changes made by the script will not be undo-able.

Please use with caution, remembering to turn undo back on at the end of
the script. Running this command by itself in the textport will cause the
undo stack to be corrupted.

If you don't specify any options, the command prints the current state.



@options
    `-s`:
        Print the memory usage of the undo stack.
    `-c`:
        Clear the undo stack, freeing the memory used.
