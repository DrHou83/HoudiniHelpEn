= opstat =

"""Print node creation time, modification time, author, and permissions."""

:usage: `opstat [-q] [-c] [-m] [-u] <<operators>> ...`
:usage: `opstat -T [<<table_name>>]`

Prints...

- Creation time
- Last modified time
- Creator's user name
- Node permissions. Use [Cmd:opchmod] to change permissions.

The "last modified" time is updated whenever:

* A child is created/destroyed/exposed/hidden in a network.
* The operator is renamed.
* An input to the OP changes.
* Any flag, parameter or channel changes.
* Any groups are changed in a network.
