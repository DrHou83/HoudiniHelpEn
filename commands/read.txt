= read =

"""Reads a line on user input into one or more variables."""

:usage: `read [-g] <<variable_name>> [<<variablename2>> ..]`

If you specify more than one variable, each argument in the line is
assigned to each variable. The last variable gets any remainder.



@options
    `-g`:
        Make the variables global (see the setenv command).
