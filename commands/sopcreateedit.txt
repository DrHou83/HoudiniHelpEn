"""Create an Edit SOP from the differences between two SOPs."""

:usage: `sopcreateedit [ -d ] [ -o ] <<name>> <<sop1>> <<sop2>> `

This command will create a Edit SOP describing an edit which will
transform the geometry of <<sop1>> to that of <<sop2>>.

NOTE:
    The number of points in <<sop1>> and <<sop2>> must be equal.



@options
    `-d`:
        If set, sop1 must be a Deform SOP. A new Edit SOP will be
        created that can replace sop2 if inserted before the Deform
        SOP.
	{{{
	before: sop1 -> deform -> sop2
	after:  sop1 -> new edit -> deform
	}}}
    `-o`:
        If set, the new Edit SOP will apply deltas relative to local
        coordinate frames specified by the "orient" attribute.
