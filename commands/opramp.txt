"""Sets a key in an operator's ramp."""

:usage: `opramp <<operator_name>> <<position>> <<r>> <<g>> <<b>> <<a>> `
:usage: `opramp -r <<operator_name>> <<position>> `

This command sets a key for a certain position in an operator's ramp,
such as the ramp of a two-tone shader. The <<position>> should be
between 0 and 1.

If the <<position>> is within 0.01 of an existing key, the command will
set the existing key's color. Otherwise, it will create a new key.

You can also use the -r option to remove keys instead of setting them.

To get a list of keys, use the opscript command on the operator.



@options
    `-r <<operator_name>> <<position>> `:
        Removes a key from the operator's ramp at the given position.
