"""Saves a DOP simulation data item to a file."""

:usage: `dopsavedata <<dopdata>> <<filename>> `

Use this command to save a single piece of DOP simulation data to a
file. This is most useful for saving data that takes a long time to
generate, but which is only generated once at the start of a simulation,
such as the Volume representation of an object for use in collision
detection.

The <<dopdata>> argument should be in the format:
<<dopnetpath:dopobject/dopdata>>.

The File Data DOP can be used to save and load a single piece of
simulation data in a procedural manner. This command allows the process
to be made part of an automated script without having to edit the DOP
Network. The files generated with this command can be loaded using a
File Data DOP.
