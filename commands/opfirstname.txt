#type: hscript

= opfirstname =

"""Changes the initial name of a node when it is put down."""

:usage: `opfirstname [<<networktype>> [<<opname>> <<firstname>>]]`

When just the `networktype` option is specified, all current `opfirstname`
commands for that network type are displayed. If no options are given,
all `opfirstname` commands for all network types are displayed.

This is usually added to the OPcustomize file.  This is useful to give
a more artist-friendly initial name for a node when the internal
name is obscure.


@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    opfirstname Sop merge "combine"
    }}}
    causes the merge SOP to be created with the name "combine1" when
    put down rather than "merge1"
