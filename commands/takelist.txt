= takelist =

"""Sets various options of the take list pane."""

:usage: `takelist [-w 0|1] [-G <<float>>] [-d <<desktop_name>>] <<pane1>> [<<pane2>> ...]`

@options
    `-w 0|1`:
        If 1, displays the take contents in a sub-pane.
    `-G <<float>> `:
        A fraction between 0 and 1, controls the size of the take list
        when it is split with the take contents sub-pane. Values closer
        to 1 make the take list bigger and the contents tree smaller.

@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    takelist -w 1 -G .4 panetab1
    }}}
    Shows the take contents tree sub-pane in panetab1, and sets the size of
    the take list to 40% of the pane.
