"""Print the time taken to execute a command."""

:usage: `time <<command>> `

Prints the time taken to execute <<command>>. On UNIX, the command
reports "u" (CPU usage) "s" (system usage) and "r" (real time). On
Windows, the command only prints real time.

To time a complicated set of commands, write it them to a .cmd file and
use "time source script.cmd".
