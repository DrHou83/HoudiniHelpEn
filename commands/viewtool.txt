:usage: `viewtool [-t <<tool_name>>] <<viewer_name>>`

This command sets the currently active tool in a scene viewer (that is,
the selected tool that shows its options in the operator control toolbar
and acts on mouse clicks and key presses). This command simulates the
effect of the user choosing a tool in the viewer, such as via the [tab
menu|/basics/tabmenu] . If no options are specified, then this command
lists all the available tools for the given viewer.

Use the [viewls|Cmd:viewls] command to list the available scene
viewers.

NOTE:
    The tools you can select depend on the viewer type. For example, you
    can only select object tools (such as [Pose|/shelf/pose])
    when the viewer is at the object level.




@options
    `-t <<tool_name>>`:
        Name of the tool to select in the viewer.

        This is the _internal_ name of the tool, not the name that
        usually shows up in the user interface, for example `xform`
        instead of `Transform`.

        Use this command without any options to obtain the list of
        available tools.


@examples
    {{{
    #!hscript
    viewtool Build.panetab1.world
    }}}
    Prints a list of tools available in the scene viewer named
    `Build.panetab1.world`. This list may depend on the viewer type (e.g.,
    POP viewer vs. SOP viewer).

    {{{
    #!hscript
    viewtool -t geo Build.panetab1.world
    }}}
    Selects the [Geometry Object|Node:obj/geo] in the scene viewer named
    `Build.panetab1.world`.

    {{{
    #!hscript
    viewtool -t polyextrude Build.panetab1.world
    }}}
    Selects the [Poly Extrude SOP|Node:sop/polyextrude] in the scene
    viewer named `Build.panetab1.world`.
