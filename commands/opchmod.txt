"""Changes the access permissions of operators."""

:usage: `opchmod <<permissions>> <<operator_pattern>> `

Permissions specify the abilities of a node's user and others to read,
write, and/or execute an operator. "Write" permission is the ability to
change parameter values. "Execute" permission is the ability to render.

The "user" is the account that created the operator. This is stored on a
per-node basis.

NOTE:
    "Group" permissions are not implemented.

To query permissions, use [Cmd:opstat].

@options

` <<permissions>> `:
    You can specify permissions in two ways (these correspond to the
    way the UNIX chmod command works).

    * A letter/symbol code where...

    * A three-digit octal number where...

@examples

{{{
#!hscript
opchmod o-rw /obj/geo1
}}}

Removes permission for others to read and/or write from /obj/geo1.

{{{
#!hscript
opchmod 777 /out/vmantra*
}}}

Gives full permissions to everyone for all nodes in /out starting
with vmantra.
