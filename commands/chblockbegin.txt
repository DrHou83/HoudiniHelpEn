"""Signals the start of a block of chadd/chkey commands in a script
file."""

:usage: `chblockbegin`

Nesting chadd/chkey commands inside a chblockbegin/chblockend block
makes the commands much faster by deferring even propagation until the
end of the block, then sending all events at once.

This command can only be used when sourcing in a script file. Calls can
be nested, but each chblockbegin command must have a corresponding
chblockend command.

You should only use chadd and chkey commands inside a
chblockbegin/chblockend block. Otherwise dependencies may not be
properly maintained.
