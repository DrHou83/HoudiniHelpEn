"""Save the current session to a hip file."""

:usage: `mwrite [-i | -b] [-n] [<<filename>>]`
:usage: `mwrite -c <<filename>> `

@options
    `-i`:
        Automatically increment filename.
    `-b`:
        Create a numbered backup. If <<filename>> already exists, then
        it is renamed to a file name containing the next number in the
        sequence before saving. The backup files are saved in the
        directory set in the environment variable HOUDINI_BACKUP_DIR. If
        HOUDINI_BACKUP_DIR is not set, then a default relative directory
        called "backup" is used.
    `-n`:
        Save a copy of the data under a different name.

    `-c <<filename>> `:
        Save a partial hip file containing only the animation channels.
        You can load the channels from such a file using mread -o -M.
