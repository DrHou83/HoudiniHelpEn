"""Loads a hip file."""

:usage: `mread [-m <<merge_pattern>> | -M] [-c] [-o] [-i] <<filename>> `

@options
    `-m <<merge_pattern>> `:
        Merges the file into the current HIP file. <<merge_pattern>>
        indicates which sections of the file to merge in.
    `-M`:
        Merge entire file in (Shortcut for -m *).
    `-c`:
        List "collisions" that would occur if a merge was done, where an
        object in the merge file has the same name as an existing
        object.
    `-o`:
        When merging, overwrite nodes with the same name as nodes in the
        merge file.
    `-i`:
        (Interactive) Acts as if the file was loaded via "File ->
        Open...". Prompts you to save the current file before loading
        the new file and it displays any load errors in a popup window.
        Also changes the name of the current file at the top of the main
        window and adds the file name to the list of most recently used
        files.

        This option is not available in hscript.

        You cannot specify other options with this option.
