"""Saves channels and parameter values from an operator as a preset."""

:usage: `oppresetsave <<op_name>> <<preset_name>> <<directory>> `

This command creates/overwrites a preset using the channels and
parameter values of the operator you specify. You can then apply that
preset to other operators of the same type using the oppresetload
command.

The <<directory>> specifies the directory in which to store the preset.
Presets are always saved inside a "presets" subdirectory inside the
directory you specify. You can only use directories in the HOUDINI_PATH
for which you have write permission.

If you do not supply any arguments, the command lists all valid
directory names.
