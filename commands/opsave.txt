"""Saves the output data of an operator to a file."""

:usage: `opsave [-q] [-v] [-f <<start>> <<end>> [-i <<inc>>]] <<operator>> <filename>> `

`opsave` currently supports CHOP, COP and SOP data.

@options
    `-q`:
        (Quiet) Do not print any messages, including warnings and
        errors.
    `-v`:
        (Verbose) Print more detailed messages.
    `-f <<start>> <<end>> `:
        Save output data for a frame range. Use the -i option to specify
        the increment.
        
        This does the equivalent of the following code:

        {{{
        #!hscript
        for i = start to end step inc fcur $i opsave operator filename end 
        }}}

        That is, it saves the operator data using the same filename for each
        frame. Unless you have an embedded variable such as `$F` or similar in the
        filename (using `\$F`), you probably don't want this option. CHOPs, for
        example, save their entire data and usually don't require the `-f`
        parameter.
        
    `-i <<increment>> `:
        The increment between frames to save. For example, 2 saves every
        other frame, 3 saves every third frame, etc.

@examples

{{{
#!hscript
opsave -f 1 10 -i 2 /obj/geo1/twist1 twist1\$F.obj 
}}}

{{{
#!hscript
opsave /ch/ch1/wave1 wave.bclip
}}}

{{{
#!hscript
opsave /ch/audio/filter1 test.aiff
