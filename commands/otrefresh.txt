= otrefresh =

"""Reloads an operator type library from disk."""

:usage: `otrefresh [-r] [<<otl_file>>]`

If you specify an <<otl_file>>, that library is reloaded, otherwise all
libraries are reloaded.

This command will rarely be necessary for most users. Any changes made
to operator definitions or operator type libraries automatically cause
refreshes in the current Houdini session. You only need to run this
command if an operator type library is modified outside the current
Houdini session (by another user, from a shell, or from another Houdini
session).



@options
    `-r`:
        the contents of the OPlibraries files are also reloaded. This
        takes more time, but allows these files to be changed by
        external applications and have a running Houdini reflect these
        changes. Libraries not found in the OPlibraries files are not
        automatically uninstalled.
