These settings are saved with the hip file. Changing these settings will
change any COP nodes that are following these next time they are output
or viewed.

@options
    `-a <<pixelAspectRatio>> `:
        Sets the pixel aspect ratio. A ratio of 2:1 (X:Y) should be
        passed as 2.
    `-d i8|i16|i32|fp`:
        Sets the project data format: 8, 16, 32 bit integer, or floating
        point.
    `-P <<zoom>> `:
        Sets the proxy zoom level. Zoom levels are: icon 1/8 1/4 1/3 1/2
        2/3 3/4 full 1.33 1.5 2 4 8
    `-p <<black>> <<white>> `:
        Sets the black and white points for integer formats.
    `-r <<xres>> <<yres>> `:
        Sets the project resolution.
    `-f on|off`:
        If on, all File COPs' resolutions are overridden by the project
        resolution (as the default setting for all new File COPs). If
        off, the files natural resolution is used.
    `-F on|off`:
        If on, all File COPs' pixel depths are overridden by the project
        pixel depth (as the default setting for all new file COPs). If
        off, the files natural depth is used.
    `-l on|off`:
        Turns Large Canvas support on or off. If on, image data outside
        of (0,0) - (`xres`, `yres`) will be retained. If off, this data is
        cropped.
    `-m <<xres>> <<yres>>`
        Sets the resolution limit. Images larger than this will error out
        rather than cook. This is to avoid accidentally creating huge images,
        which can crash the application.
