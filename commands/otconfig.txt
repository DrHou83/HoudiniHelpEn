"""Sets various options of the operator type manager."""

:usage: `otconfig [-b 0|1] [-d 0|1] [-i 0|1] [-l 0|1] [-o 0|1] [-s 0|1] [-S 0|1] [-u 0|1] [-w 0|1] [-x 0|1] [-y 0|1]`

The options in this command correspond to the options available in the
Operator Type Manager dialog, which you can show using the Tools menu.

You can turn each option on or off by specifying 1 or 0. All changes
take effect immediately and are saved to a configuration file in your
HOME directory.

Use the otprefer command to override these global options for a specific
operator type. This lets you explicitly choose the source for a
particular operator type definition.

If you don't specify any options, the command prints the current
values.

@options
    `-x 0|1`:
        Give preference to definitions from index files. Any operator
        definitions listed in index files take precedence over
        definitions for the same operators found in operator type
        libraries. Turn on this option if you have operator definitions
        that need to be shared between this version of Houdini and
        versions 5.5 or earlier.
    `-i 0|1`:
        Give preference to definitions saved in hip file. Hip files can
        optionally embed an operator type library containing definitions
        for all operators used in the hip file. If this option is on,
        these definitions stored in the Hip file are given precedence
        over definitions for the same operators stored in other operator
        type libraries. Turn on this option if you don't want future
        changes to operator definitions to affect the functioning of
        your hip files. The "-x" option takes precedence over this
        option.
    `-l 0|1`:
        Give precedence to definitions with latest date. If this option
        is on and there are several definitions available for a single
        operator, Houdini will use the one which was modified most
        recently. If this option is off, Houdini uses the order in which
        the operator type libraries are loaded to determine which
        definition to use. The "-x" and "-i" options take precedence
        over this option.
    `-s 0|1`:
        Save operator definitions to hip file. If this option is on,
        whenever you save your Hip file, Houdini will embed an operator
        type library into the file. This library contains the operator
        definitions for all operators used in the Hip file. Turning this
        option off will reduce the disk space used by your Hip files,
        but if you delete one of the operator definitions used by the
        Hip file, the Hip file will not be able to create the deleted
        operator(s).
    `-S 0|1`:
        Save definitions of unlocked assets to hip file. If this option
        is on, whenever you save your Hip file, Houdini will embed an
        operator type library into the file. This library contains the
        operator definitions for all operator types in the Hip file that
        have at least one instance which is set to allow editing of its
        contents. If the save operator definitions to hip file option is
        turned on, this option doesn't matter because all operator type
        definitions will be saved in the hip file whether or not there
        are any unlocked instances. This option is for hip files which
        have required modifications to an asset instance. In that case,
        changes to the external asset definition may invalidate the
        changes to the asset made within the hip file. By saving the
        definitions of these unlocked assets to the hip file these
        conflicts can be avoided. When this option is on, it is a good
        idea to also turn on the option to give preference to
        definitions saved in hip file. This will ensure that any changes
        to the external asset definition are ignored by this hip file.
    `-u 0|1`:
        Leave Values When Defaults Change. If this option is turned on,
        parameters at their default values are not changed when a new
        definition for the operator type is loaded with a new set of
        default values. If this option is turned off, then parameters at
        their old default values are changed to match the new default
        values.
    `-w 0|1`:
        Display warning for out of date operators. If this option and -i
        are on, Houdini checks the modification times of all operator
        definitions embedded in the hip file. If it finds that the
        embedded definition is not as recent as another definition
        available on disk, it opens a warning dialog to notify you that
        the Hip file contains operator definitions that are out of
        date.
    `-y 0|1`:
        Display warning during load when nodes use an incomplete asset
        definition because a complete definition is not available.
    `-b 0|1`:
        Create backup files when saving libraries. If this option is on,
        any time an operator type library file is saved a backup copy of
        the file will be created. This feature ensures that any changes
        you make to an operator definition can be undone. By default the
        backups are made in a "backup" subdirectory of the operator type
        library's path. You can override this location by setting the
        HOUDINI_BACKUP_DIR environment variable.
    `-d 0|1`:
        Safeguard operator definitions. Removes "Allow Editing of
        Contents"/"Match Current Definition" from the context menu.
        Hiding this option affords a level of security preventing the
        user from modifying operator definitions.
    `-o 0|1`:
        Use OPlibraries files to find HDAs. This option controls how Houdini
        finds HDA files to load when starting up. With this option on, Houdini
        searches the HOUDINI_PATH for files named OPlibraries which contain
        lists of HDA file names to load. With this option off, Houdini scans
        for *.hda in all directories specified by the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH
        environment variable. This path defaults to the hda subdirectory of
        every directory in the HOUDINI_PATH.

NOTE:
    If only HOUDINI_PATH is defined, then Houdini always uses the most recent .hda in the path.
