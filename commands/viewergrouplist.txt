"""Set group list options of viewer panes."""

:usage: `viewergrouplist [<<options>>] <<viewports>> `

Similar to vieweroption, this command allows you to set display options for a 
viewer pane, but specifically related to the group list control. See
[how to refer to viewers and viewports|/commands/_index#viewers]. Running
this command with no options outputs the command that describes the current
state of the group list gadget.

@options
    `-g on|off`:
          Turns the group and attribute list gadget on or off in the viewer.
          This corresponds to the Group and Attribute List check box on the
          Guides page of the Display Options dialog for a geometry viewer.

    `-s <<width>> <<height>>`:
          Controls the width and height of the group and attribute list gadget.

    `-c on|off`:
          Turns on or off the coloring of the different groups or attribute
          values in the geometry viewer. Only has an effect if the group list
          gadget is also turned on.

    `-t <<component_type>>`:
          Controls the type of component that should be shown in the group list
          gadget. Supported values are:

          primitive:
              List primitive groups or attribute values or connectivity.
          point:
              List point groups or attribute values or connectivity.
          edge:
              List edge groups or connectivity.
          vertex:
              List vertex attribute values or connectivity.
          breakpoint:
              List breakpoint connectivity.
          matchselect:
              The group list component type changes with the current component
              selection type.

    `-m <<mask>>`:
          Sets the group or attribute mask value for the group list gadget.

    `-e on|off`:
          Turns on or off the inclusion of empty groups in the group list
          gadget.

    `-p on|off`:
          Turns on or off the trimming of the group list contents to show
          only groups that contain one or more selected or pre-selected
          components (if any components are under the mouse in the viewport).

    `-h on|off`:
          Turns on or off the condensing of the hierarchy in the group list.
          This applies to components grouped by string attributes representing
          a path. Turning this option on can fit more information into the
          list, but can make it harder to distinguish levels in the hierarchy.
