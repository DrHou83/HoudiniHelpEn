"""Forces a VOP Network to compile its code."""

:usage: `vopforcecompile <<vop_node>>`

<<vop_node>> can be either a VOP node or a VOPNET node. If you specify
a VOP node, the command will use its enclosing VOPNET. The VOPNET is
forced to generate its code, and then compile that code. Any compile
errors will be reported as warnings on the VOP nodes. This is useful
for testing the validity of code generated by a VOP Network without
having to start a render or use the Shader View.
