:usage: `otprefer <<table>>/<<operator>> `
:usage: `otprefer <<table>>/<<operator>> <<otl_file>> `

It is possible for the same operator definition to be available from
several different OTL files in the same Houdini session. This command
lets you choose a particular OTL file to use as the source for an
operator definition. This overrides the global options set with the
otconfig command.

Without any arguments, the command prints the current overrides.

If you give a <<table>>/<<operator>> pair without an <<otl_file>>, the
command prints the current override, if any, for that operator type.

If you give a <<table>>/<<operator>> pair and an <<otl_file>>, the
command sets the given library as the source for the operator type.

The <<table>> value specifies the class of the operator you want to
modify. A list of valid table names is found in the help for the otwrite
command. The <<operator>> value is the name of the specific operator
type.



@options
    `-c`:
        Clear all overrides.
