In this tutorial we will use the example of a tube top on a female model.

# Create a [Icon:SOP/tube][Tube|/shelf/tube], change its __Primitive Type__ to __Polygon__, and add increase the __Rows__ and __Columns__ to a reasonable level of details. In this example, the tube has 10 rows and 40 columns.

# Model the tube so that it fits roughly around the character's torso without intersecting.

# Use the [Icon:DOP/clothobject][Cloth Object|/shelf/clothobject] shelf tool to turn the tube into a cloth object.

# Use the [Icon:DOP/clothbodycollider][Deforming Collider|/shelf/clothbodycollider] from the __Cloth__ shelf to turn the body into a Static Object that supported continuous, geometry-based collisions.

# To attach the top of the shirt to the body, click [Icon:DOP/clothattachtobody][Attach to Body|/shelf/clothattachtobody] on the __Cloth__ shelf tab and follow the prompts. 

    * Select the top and press ((Enter)). 
    * Select the points around the top row of the shirt and press ((Enter)).
        TIP:
            You can select one point on the top row of the skirt and press the hotkey ((L)) to loop around and select all of the points.

    * Select the character's body and press ((Enter)) to create a set of constraints.

# Lower the __Distance__ parameter on the [Icon:SOP/peak][Peak SOP|Node:sop/peak] just enough so the cloth penetrates the cloth body. In this example we used a value of `0.03`.

    TIP:
        To get the clothes to fit really tight to the body, reduce the __Cloth Thickness__ on the __Collisions__ tab of the [Cloth Object|/shelf/clothobject].

# Press [Icon:PLAYBAR/play_forward]play on the Playbar to view the simulation.

TIP:
    You can attach a [Icon:SOP/smooth][Smooth SOP|Node:sop/smooth] after the 'SIMULATED' [Icon:COMMON/null][Null node|Node:sop/null] to give the tube top a softer shape.
