= How to |> make pockets in clothing =

This is a simple tutorial about how to add pockets to a piece of cloth. In this example we will use a simple grid instead of a modeled piece of clothing; however, the same workflow applies.

NOTE:
    To stitch cloth, the topology has to be exactly the same so that the points line up.

# Create a [Icon:SOP/grid][Grid|/shelf/grid]. Make its size 1 by 1, give it 20 rows and 20 columns, and orient it to the XY plane.

# Duplicate the [Grid|/shelf/grid] you just created. An easy way to do this is by copying and pasting the existing node in the network editor.

# Dive into the second grid object. In the viewport, transform it forward slightly so that it is not directly on top of the initial one.

# Select some surrounding primitives. You should leave a patch big enough to become the pocket.

    TIP:
        Holding ((Shift)) will allow you to easily select the surrounding primitives.

# Press ((Del)) to remove the primitives.

# Use the [Icon:DOP/clothobject][Cloth Object|/shelf/clothobject] shelf tool to turn both grids into cloth objects.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/cloth_follow_animation][Follow Target|/shelf/clothfollowanimation] shelf tool, and choose the larger piece of cloth to constrain. Then select the top two corners, and press ((Enter)). This will prevent the cloth from falling down when simulating.

# Click the [Icon:DOP/clothstitchconstraint][Stitch Cloth|/shelf/clothstitch] shelf tool, select the pocket, then press ((Enter)). Next select the points around the bottom and sides of the pocket to constrain, and press ((Enter)).

    TIP:
        It may be easier to select the next set of points if you display geometry as wireframe.

# Choose the larger piece of cloth as the dynamic object to stitch to and press ((Enter)). Then select the points for the pocket to stitch to. 

    NOTE:
        If you want your pocket to stick out more, select the points one row smaller than the size of the pocket.

# Change the constraint __Type__ to __Hard__ so that the pocket stays stuck to the cloth at the constraint points.

# Press [Icon:PLAYBAR/play_forward]play on the Playbar to view the simulation.
