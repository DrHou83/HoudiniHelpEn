Polygon problems:
    The [PolyDoctor SOP|Node:sop/polydoctor] was created to take polygon surfaces and analyze and repair for simulation by the [Cloth Solver|Node:dop/clothsolver]. Clean geometry is essential for a high-quality cloth simulation. You can use the [PolyDoctor SOP|Node:sop/polydoctor] to fix all kinds of issues with polygonal geometry. It can detect a polygon with multiple vertices indexing the same point causing nasty wing edged geometry. The [PolyDoctor SOP|Node:sop/polydoctor] will detect these cases and it has automatic fixes for most of them. It will detect self-intersecting regions, which will cause issues for the [Cloth Solver|Node:dop/clothsolver]. It will also remove very small polygons and a host of other issues with polygonal geometry. 

Jittery cloth:
    Increase the number of substeps on the solver until the problem goes away.

Collisions:
    As a general rule, the thickness should be 1% of the size of the polygons on the cloth. You can use the parameters on the __Visualization__ tab to check if there is a __Thickness__ or __Penetration__ problem.
