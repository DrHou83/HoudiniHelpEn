In this example, we will make a crease in a simple tube, since it is similar to a pant leg.

# Create a [Icon:SOP/tube][Tube|/shelf/tube], change its __Primitive Type__ to __Polygon__, and add increase the __Rows__ and __Columns__ to a reasonable level of details. In this example, the tube has and __Height__ of `5` , `40` __Rows__ and, `50` __Columns__.

# Select an edge for your crease.

# With the edge selected, create a group by pressing ((Tab)) in the viewport and typing [Group Geometry|Node:sop/group]. 

# Give the edge group a __Group Name__. For example, `crease`.

# In the [network editor|/ref/panes/network], add an [Attribute Create|Node:sop/attribcreate] after the [Group |Node:sop/group] node and in the __Group__ parameter, use your edge group name. For example `crease`.

# Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/add] button two more times to create a total of three attributes.

# __Name__ the first attribute `shellstretchstiffness`, with a __Default__ of `1`, and a __Value__ of `3`. Do the same thing for two more attributes: `shellshearstiffness` and `shellweakbendstiffness`. This will make the crease 3 times as stiff as the rest of the pant leg.

# Use the [Icon:DOP/clothobject][Cloth Object|/shelf/clothobject] shelf tool to turn the tube into a cloth object.

# For this example we will simply pin the top of the tube so it does not fall by clicking the [Icon:SHELF/cloth_follow_animation][Follow Target|/shelf/clothfollowanimation] shelf tool, and choosing the top loop of the tube to constrain.

        NOTE:
                In a real-life example you would be attaching the pants to the waist using the [Icon:DOP/clothattachtobody][Attach to Body|/shelf/clothattachtobody] on the __Cloth__ shelf tab and following the prompts. See [How to create a simple cloth skirt and attach it to a character|createskirt].

# Add an [Edit SOP|Node:sop/edit] before the __DOP Import__ node and model the crease by selecting the edge again and transforming it out as far as you want it. 

        TIP:
                You can type your edge group name, for example `crease` in the __Group__ parameter to quickly select the edge to transform. Additionally, increasing the __Soft Radius__ will make a more natural looking crease.

# Press [Icon:PLAYBAR/play_forward]play on the Playbar to view the simulation. Your cloth should hang with a stiff crease.
