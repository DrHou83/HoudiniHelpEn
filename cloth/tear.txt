In this example we will show a piece of cloth being torn when it collides with a sphere.

# Create a [Icon:SOP/sphere][Sphere|/shelf/sphere] and make the __Primitive Type__ a __Primitive__.

# Create a [Icon:SOP/grid][Grid|/shelf/grid]. Make its size 3 by 3, give it 31 rows and 31 columns, and raise it up above the sphere.

# Click the [Icon:DOP/rigidcollider][Rigid Collider|/shelf/rigidcollider] shelf tool to turn the sphere into a Static Object with volume-based collisions.

# Use the [Icon:DOP/clothobject][Cloth Object|/shelf/clothobject] shelf tool to turn the grid into a piece of cloth.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/cloth_follow_animation][Follow Target|/shelf/clothfollowanimation] shelf tool, and choose the piece of  cloth to constrain. Select two adjacent corners, and press ((Enter)). This will pin the cloth at those two points and cause it to swing downward into the sphere.

# On the Cloth Object, turn on the __Enable Fracturing__ toggle and set the __Fracture Threshold__ to 0.00001.

# Press [Icon:PLAYBAR/play_forward]play on the Playbar to view the simulation.
