= Emit Particle Fluid =

"""Emits fluid in a particle fluid simulation."""

This tool can be used, for example, to simulate water pouring out of a tab, bucket, or watering can. It continuously generates particle based fluid, as opposed to the [Icon:SHELF/source_from_volume][Source from volume|sourcefromvolume] tool which continuously generates volume based fluid.

== Using Emit Particle Fluid == (includeme)
    # Create a geometry object in the shape you want to emit fluid.
    
    # In the __Particle Fluids__ shelf tab, click the [Icon:DOP/particlefluidemitter] Emit Particle Fluid tool.

    # Select the geometry object to emit the fluid, then press ((Enter)).

    # If you have an existing particle fluid object you want to add the new emitter to, select it and press ((Enter)).
    
        Otherwise, just press ((Enter)) and the tool will create a new particle fluid object for you.
