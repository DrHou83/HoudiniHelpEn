"""Turns on the dynamics on an object."""

This tool is used to activate [dynamic|/dyno/rbd] objects, which are controlled by the simulation. You need to create a dynamic object before you can use this tool.

    #  Select the dynamic objects to activate.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/rbd_activate][Activate Objects|Node:dop/rbdkeyactive] tool on the __Drive Simulation__ tab.
