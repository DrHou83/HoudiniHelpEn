= Null =

"""Creates a null object which can be used to hold a place in a scene, and never renders."""

A [Icon:OBJ/null] [Null|/nodes/obj/null] object can also be used as an End Affector for constructing chains of [bones|/shelf/bones]. 

It is often used as a parent, which can be used to rotate and transform multiple objects at once. 

[Null|/nodes/obj/null] objects can also be used in [animation|/anim] with a [Look At|lookat]. You can set the [Icon:OBJ/camera][Camera|Node:obj/cam] to look at the null object instead of the actual character so that the camera follows the character but does not move with it. Using the null this way will prevent the camera from moving up and down if a character is jumping.

== Placing a Null in the viewer == (includeme)
    
    :task:Place the null anywhere in the scene:
        # Click the [Icon:OBJ/null] [Null|/nodes/obj/null] tool on the __Create__ tab.
            
        # Move the cursor into the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
            NOTE:
                You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the null from the construction plane.
            
        # Click ((LMB)) to place the [null|/nodes/obj/null] anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
            If you press ((Enter)) without clicking, Houdini places the null at the origin.
        
    :task:Place the null at the origin:
        Press ((Ctrl + LMB)) on the [Icon:OBJ/null] [Null|/nodes/obj/null] tool on the [shelf|/shelf].

    You can change the display, control type, and shading of the null on the __Misc__ tab of the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:OBJ/null] [Null|/nodes/obj/null] node help.
