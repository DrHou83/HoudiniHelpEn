= Smoke Container =

"""Creates a container that can hold smoke."""

This tool can be used, for example, to simulate a smokestack.

== Using Smoke Container ==

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke] Smoke Container button on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.
    
    # Place the container anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

:task:Create smoke in the container:
    
    # Place a geometry object inside the container.
    
    # Use the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source][Source from volume|sourcefromvolume] tool to turn the geometry object into a smoke object.
    
:task:Change the amount of divisions in the container:
    
    Edit the __Divisions__ on the operation controls toolbar or in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
        
    Reducing the divisions will make your simulation faster and increasing the divisions will make your simulations more detailed.
        
:task:Let the smoke escape the boundaries of the container:
    
    Turn off the __Closed Boundaries__ checkbox on the operation controls toolbar or in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

NOTE:
    The large tick marks indicate 10 divisions. So, the smoke container in this example has 20 divisions.

A possible next step could be to eliminate some smoke. To remove smoke from a simulation, use the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_sink][Sink from Objects|sinkfromobjects] tool on the Fluids shelf.

You may also want to add some turbulence to your smoke. You can do this by applying [Icon:SHELF/seedvorticles][Seed Vorticles|seedvorticles].
