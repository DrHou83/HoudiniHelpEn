"""This tool lets you paint higher or lower temperature on geometry in your fire simulation."""

== Using Paint Temperature == (includeme)

# Create a fire simulation.

# Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/resimulate] Resimulate menu in the bottom right corner of Houdini and turn off the __Enable Simulation__ option. 

    NOTE:
        The icon may be greyed out [Icon:BUTTONS/resimulate_inactive]. Once you turn off this option the icon will change to a "do not" [Icon:COMMON/delete] symbol.
        
# In the current DopNetwork, find the Gas Burn Geometry node (usually called `burnsolver`) for the object you want to paint and change the __Ignition Temperature__ to `0.01` and __Ignition Range__ to `0.001`.

    In this example we modified `burnsolver1` which was the Gas Burn Geometry for the torus object.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/paint_temperature] Paint Temperature tool on the __Volume Fluids__ shelf.

# Select the object you want to paint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. 
        
# Set the value to paint in the Operation Controls toolbar, and drag the [brush|/basics/brush] over the surface to paint it.
    
        TIP:
            You can change the __Radius__ of your brush by holding ((Shift + LMB)) and dragging or by changing the value in the Operation Controls toolbar. You can also alter the __Opacity__ in the Operation Controls toolbar.
            
# Click the "do not" [Icon:COMMON/delete] icon in the bottom right corner of Houdini and turn the __Enable Simulation__ option back on.

The torus object burns quicker in places where the painted temperature is higher than the __Ignition Temperature__ on the `burnsolver` (Gas Burn Geometry) node. In this example, the far side of the torus ignites before the side closer to the sphere because the ignition temperature is higher.

NOTE:
    Heat is transferred within the smoke box, so an object can become hot enough to ignite before a flame from another object comes in contact with it.
