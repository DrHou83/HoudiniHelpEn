    # Select the points for the ripple.
        NOTE:
            This tool works well when there are many points selected. If you are placing a ripple on a [Icon:SOP/grid][grid|Node:sop/grid], increase the rows and columns.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/ripple][Ripple|Node:sop/ripple] tool on the __Deform__ tab.
            
    # Use the __Frequency__, __Height__, and __Wave Decay__ parameters to create the ripple.
        NOTE: 
            The wave decay default setting is very high. Decrease its value for a more visible ripple effect.
