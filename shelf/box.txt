"""Creates a cube or six-sided rectangular box."""

== Placing a Box in the viewer == (placing)
    :task:Place the box anywhere in the scene:
        # Click the [Icon:SOP/box] [Box|/nodes/sop/box] tool on the __Create__ tab.
            
        # Move the cursor into the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
            NOTE:
                You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the box from the construction plane.
            
        # Click ((LMB)) to place the box anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
            If you press ((Enter)) without clicking, Houdini places the box at the origin.
        
    :task:Place the box at the origin:
        Press ((Ctrl + LMB)) on the [Icon:SOP/box] [Box|/nodes/sop/box] tool on the [shelf|/shelf/].
    
    NOTE: 
        The box can be moved once it is placed by either dragging it in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] or changing the values in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
