== Tube Handles ==
There are special handles available at the geometry level for the tube object that allow you to change the radius of the individual circumferences.
    
    # Create a tube object.
    
    # Move to the geometry level by double clicking ((LMB)) the tube node in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network] or by clicking the __Jump to Operator__ button on the operation controls toolbar.
    
    # Drag the handles to change the radii of the tube.
    
    :task:Change the radius of the top:
        Drag the red handle.
            
    :task:Change the radius of the bottom:
        Drag the green handle.

== End Cap ==
You can cap the ends of a tube by turning on the __End Cap__ checkbox on the operation controls toolbar. However, the caps are not automatically fused to the tube. You can fuse the points by using the [Icon:SOP/fuse][Fuse|Node:sop/fuse] tool on the __Polygon__ tab of the [shelf|/shelf].

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/tube] [Tube|/nodes/sop/tube] node help.
