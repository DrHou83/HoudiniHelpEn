"""UV Edit allows interactive editing of the UVs on the source geometry."""

Make sure the object has UVs and a [Icon:SHOP/vopmaterial][Material|/shade/materials] assigned to it. 

You also need to have a texture projected onto a [model|/model] in order to use the UV Edit tool. This tool is useful for manually editing the UVs on source geometry.

    # Click the [Icon:SOP/uvedit][UV Edit|Node:sop/uvedit] tool on the __Texture__ tab.
    
        NOTE:
            You can load the texture image as the background in your UV viewport to easily view edit changes.
            
    # Select the primitives, points, edges, or vertices to edit and drag the handles to move the UVs.
