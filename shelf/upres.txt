"""Adds the nodes necessary to up-res a fluid container."""

This tool lets you add up-res nodes when you are building your own fluid or Pyro network from scratch. The network created by the tools on the Pyro FX shelf tab create the up-res nodes automatically. See [how to use Pyro effects|/pyro/pyro] for a description of adding resolution.

    # Select the fluid container object you want to up-res.
    
    # On the __Fluid Containers__ shelf tab, click [Icon:DOP/gasupres] Up-res Container.
    
    The tool creates a new DOP network containing the nodes for up-rezzing the selected container.
