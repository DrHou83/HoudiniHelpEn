= Melt Object =

"""Creates a melting object from geometry."""

This tool turns a geometry object into a particle fluid with a temperature attribute that affects the viscosity of the object. You would typically want to use this tool whenever you have an object that will change state over time. For example, you could use this tool to create a warm chocolate bunny that would slump over and then cool off and become solid.

TIP:
    You will often want to use this tool in conjunction with the [Heat Within Object|/shelf/heatwithinobject] shelf tool, which would allow you to have an object that melts when it comes in contact with the temperature generated from another object.
    
NOTE:
    The difference between this tool and [Lava From Object|/shelf/lavafromobject] is that this tool doesn't apply any shader. The [Lava From Object|/shelf/lavafromobject] assigns a shader to get a basic glowing lava look.


== Using Melt Object ==

# Create a geometry object to be converted into a melting object.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/melt]__Melt Object__ tool on the Viscous Fluids tab. 

    For specific parameter information, see the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject] and [Gas Temperature Update|Node:dop/gastemperatureupdate] help pages.
