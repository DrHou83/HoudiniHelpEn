= Mirror =

"""Duplicates and mirrors objects or geometry across a mirror plane."""

== Overview ==

Mirror works at both the [Scene and Geometry levels|/basics/objects].

* At the Scene level, the [Icon:SOP/mirror][Mirror|/nodes/sop/mirror] tool creates new mirror duplicates of the selected objects. You can use the controls in the operation controls toolbar (across the top of the viewer) to automatically rename the objects as you duplicate them, for example `r_arm` is mirrored as `l_arm`.

    This is useful for rigging one side of a [character|/character/] and then duplicating the [Icon:OBJ/bone][Bones|Node:obj/bone] to the other side.
    
* At the Geometry level, the tool creates a [Mirror surface node|Node:sop/mirror] which mirrors the selected geometry.

== Using Mirror == (includeme)

    At the Scene level:
        # Select the object(s) you want to mirror.
    
        # Click the [Icon:SOP/mirror][Mirror|/nodes/sop/mirror] tool on the __Modify__ tab.
    
        # Select a plane in which to mirror the object from the drop-down menu on the operation controls toolbar.

    At the Geometry level:
        # Select the [curves|/shelf/curve] and/or surfaces you want to mirror.
        
        # Click the [Icon:SOP/mirror][Mirror|/nodes/sop/mirror] tool on the __Modify__ tab.
        
        # Use the handles to move and rotate the symmetry plane.
