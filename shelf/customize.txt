"""How to change the look of the shelf, change and rearrange its contents, and create your own shelf tools."""

== Overview ==

The [shelf|/shelf] is the strip of icons along the top of the main window. It gives you quick access to commonly used functions. You can customize the shelf to set up your own tabs, as well as add your own scripts and digital assets to the shelf.

The shelf has three basic units of customization:

Shelf set:
    A set of tabs appearing in their own resizable partition of the shelf. 

Tab:
    A set of tools appearing inside a shelf set. The same tab can be present in multiple shelf sets.
    
Tool:
    An icon hooked up to a script to activate a tool or perform some other action. The same tool can be present on multiple tabs.

Both tabs and shelf sets are saved to .shelf files. Tabs define the tab name/label and the tools to display in the correct order. Shelf sets contains the tabs and the order to display them.

All tools are saved in toolbar tabs. All toolbar tabs are saved in a single .shelf file on disk in a the `$HOUDINI_TOOLBAR_PATH` or in a toolbar directory within the `$HOUDINI_PATH`. Shelf sets are collections of toolbar tabs and are also saved in .shelf a file containing the references to the toolbar tabs.
