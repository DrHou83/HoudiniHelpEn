= Curve =

"""Creates polygonal, NURBS, or Bezier curves."""

== Placing Curves == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/curve][Curve|Node:sop/curve] shelf option on the __Create__ tab.
    
    # Select either Polygon, NURBS, or Bezier from the Primitive Type menu on the operation controls toolbar.
    
    # Move the mouse into the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] and click ((LMB)) to place the points.
    
        The points are grounded on the construction plane. You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the curve from the construction plane or hold ((Ctrl)) to constrain the placement of the points within 45 degree angles.
        
        You can also [reorient the construction plane|/model/aids] completely before drawing the curve.
        
    # Press ((Enter)) or ((Shift + RMB)) to finish the curve.
        
    :task:Delete the last placed point:
        Press ((Del)).
        
    :task:Move the points of the curve:
        Click and drag them once they are created.
         
        NOTE: 
            You can only move individual points at the geometry level. At the object level you can move the entire curve. 
        
    :task:Insert points on an existing curve:
        Press ((Shift + LMB)) on the curve.
            
    :task:Insert points on the curve:
        Press ((Shift + LMB)) anywhere in the scene view.
        
    :task:Connect the first and last points of the curve:
        Turn on the __Close__ checkbox on the operation controls toolbar.
        NOTE:
            The closed curve will appear as a surface in shaded mode.
                
    :task:Change the order for NURBS and bezier:
        Set it in the operation controls toolbar.
    
        
    === NURBS and Bezier===
    
    You can create either NURBS or bezier curves with the curve shelf tool. These types of curves allow you to choose CVs, Breakpoint (knots), or Freehand from the Method menu on the operation controls toolbar. NURBS automatically determine the start and end points of your curve, whereas bezier curves recognize the first point as the start point, the second and third points as control points, and the fourth point as the end point. If the bezier curve has more than four points, the fourth point is also recognized as the start point for the next set of points.

    === Polygons ===
    
    You can also create polygons with the curve shelf tool, and choose either CVs, Breakpoint (knots), or Freehand from the Method menu on the operation controls toolbar; however, when creating polygons both CVs and Breakpoint will act the same way (allow you to place points in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]).

== Rendering Curves ==

Rendering curves is done the same way as rendering other objects. However, there are special attributes you can add to curves before rendering. For example, you can specify a desired width or orientation.

=== Adding Attributes to Curves ===

# Create a curve in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

# At the geometry level, create an `AttribCreate` node using the [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu], and connect it to your [Icon:SOP/curve][Curve|Node:sop/curve] node.

# In the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] of the [Icon:SOP/attribcreate][Attribute Create|Node:sop/attribcreate] node, modify the values.
    :task:Specify the width of the curve:
        Change the __Name__ to width, __Type__ to Float, and enter the __Value__ for the width.
    :task:Specify the orientation of the curve:
        Change the __Name__ to orient, __Type__ to Vector and enter the __Value__ for the orientation.

# Set up [lights and cameras|/shelf/lightsandcameras], and render the curve.
    For more information, see the [Rendering|/render/] chapter.
