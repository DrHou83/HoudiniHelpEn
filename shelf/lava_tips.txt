    :task: Change how quickly the objects starts to melt:
        Modify the __Temperature__ parameter on the __Physical__ tab of the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject]. This parameter sets the initial temperature of the object. The default value is 0.5, which will cause it to melt immediately, since the object starts off quite warm. A higher value will give you very hot, free-flowing liquid which cools over time and a lower value would give you cool, highly viscous fluid that heats up and melts.
        
    :task: Change the look of the fluid:
        Adjust the __Minimum/Maximum Viscosity__ parameters on the [Gas Temperature Update|Node:dop/gastemperatureupdate] node. A value of 100,000 is very stiff, which should retain it's shape, and a value of 0 is completely liquid, like water.
        
    :task: Control how quickly a hot temperature will cool off:
        Modify the __Outer/Inner Cooling Rate__ parameters on the [Gas Temperature Update|Node:dop/gastemperatureupdate] node. The __Outer Cooling Rate__ refers to the rate of change on the surface of the object, while the __Inner Cooling Rate__ refers to how fast the temperature changes inside the fluid. Generally, the inner cooling should be lower than the outer, since the inside of the object is insulated and retains more heat, as opposed to the exterior which loses heat more quickly due to the surrounding air.
