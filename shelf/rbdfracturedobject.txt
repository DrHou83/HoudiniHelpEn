= RBD Fractured Object =

"""Creates a number of RBD Objects from SOP Geometry. These individual RBD Objects are created from the geometry primitive groups."""

The RBD Fractured Object creates multiple [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD objects|/shelf/rbdobject] inside the [dynamic operation simulation|Node:obj/dopnet]. It takes the geometry from the given surface operator path and breaks it into pieces according to the [group mask|Node:dop/group]. This tool is useful to simulate an object shattering.

NOTE:
	This tool is meant to be used with user-defined fractures. It will not break up the surface for you. It will create RBD objects out of the pieces you give it.

== Using RBD Fractured Objects == (includeme)
    
    # Select the geometry to convert to an RBD fractured object.
    
    # Define the pieces to be fractured. For example, using the [Shatter tool|/shelf/shatter].

    # Select the object and click the [Icon:DOP/rbdfracturedobject][RBD Fractured Object|Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.
    
    # Choose whether to use an [RBD Packed Object|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject] or an [RBD Fractured Object|Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject].

    NOTE:
        Once you convert geometry to an RBD fractured object you can only [transform, rotate, and scale|/basics/handles] it when it is on the first frame.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/rbdpackedobject][RBD Packed Object|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject] or [Icon:DOP/rbdfracturedobject][RBD Fractured Object|Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject] help.

== Switching to the dynamics level ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the RBD fracture object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
