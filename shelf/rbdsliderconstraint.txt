= Slider Constraint =

"""Constrains an object to rotate and translate on a single axis, and limits the rotation and translation on that axis"""

This tool can be used to create objects capable of moving on a single axis, such as pistons.

You need to create an [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD object|/shelf/rbdobject] to apply this constraint to before you can use this tool.

This constraint type is currently only supported by the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

NOTE:
        This constraint will not work with packed primitives. However, you can achieve the equivalent using a [constraint network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork], such as the one created by the [Icon:PARTS/glue][Glue Adjacent|/shelf/gluenetwork] shelf tool.

== Using RBD Slider Constraints == (includeme)

    # Click the [RBD Slider Constraint|Node:dop/rbdsliderconstraint] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

    # Select the object to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Select the position for the slider constraint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

	NOTE:
	    You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the constraint from the construction plane.

    # Set the __Goal Hinge Axis__ and  __Goal Up Axis__ on the __Slider__ tab in the parameter editor. To restrict the range of motion, modify __Max Rotation__ and __Slide Range__.

For specific parameter help see the [RBD Slider Constraint|Node:dop/rbdsliderconstraint] dynamics node help.

== Moving an RBD Slider Constraint ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the constrained object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

# Click ((RMB)) the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button and turn on the __Dynamics Modifiers__ checkbox.

# Click ((LMB)) the constraint you want to edit and press ((Enter)) to display the [transformation handles|/basics/handles#basic-handles].
