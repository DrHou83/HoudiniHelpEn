"""Creates a FLIP fluid simulation from an underlying ocean surface."""

This tool creates a FLIP tank simulation with particles initialized from an ocean surface with velocities. A _boundary layer_ of particles suppresses reflections at the edge of the tank, contributes ocean velocities back to the simulation, and maintains the water volume level to match the ocean. This _boundary layer_ also applies ocean velocities at the _closed boundaries_ to allow in/out-flow of the FLIP simulation.

The Wave Tank can be a static tank or can follow a moving object through the ocean.

The [Ocean Spectrum|Node:sop/oceanspectrum] node allows you to shape the initial frame of your simulated ocean, and [Ocean Source|Node:sop/oceansource] controls the outputs. 

TIP:
    For more information, see the [differences between ocean tank types|/shelf/ocean_differences] help page.

== Using Wave Tank ==
    
# Click the [Icon:SHELF/wave_tank] __Wave Tank__ tool on the __Oceans__ tab to create a tank.  

# Select an animated object to follow and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. If no object is selected, you will be prompted to place a static tank.
