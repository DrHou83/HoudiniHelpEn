"""Constrains a region of a finite-element object to a region that is determined by another finite-element object or a Static Object."""

This tool creates a [Region Constraint|Node:dop/sbdregionconstraint] node for a selected constrained object and a selected goal region object.

# Select the object to constrain to a region.

# On the __Solid__ tab, click the [Icon:SHELF/constrainregion] Constrain Region tool.

# Select the object that defines the goal region.

For parameter help, see the [Region Constraint node|Node:dop/sbdregionconstraint] help.
