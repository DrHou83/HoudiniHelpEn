"""Continuously generates smoke, fire, or liquid from a geometry object into a container."""

== Overview ==

These tools create nodes that convert the object into a volume and cause it to continuously emit smoke/fire/liquid into a container.

"Source from Surface" and "Source from Volume" are similar, however "Source from Volume" requires that the selected geometry form a closed ("airtight") volume. "Source from Surface" can be used on both open and closed geometry.

See [fluid sourcing|/dyno/fluid_sourcing] for information on how the tool transforms the input object into a source for the effect.

This tool continuously generates fluid from the surface of an object, and is similar to [Source from Volume|sourcefromvolume]. Both create a continuous flow of fluid; however, this tool is can be applied to both open and closed volume objects. [Source from Volume|sourcefromvolume] cannot be applied to open objects, such as grids or curves because they do not have volumes.

Keep in mind, this tool generates volume based fluid, as opposed to the [Icon:DOP/particlefluidemitter][Emit Particle Fluid|emitparticlefluid] tool which generates particle based fluid.

TIP:
    If you are sourcing from an object that deforms, or collides with a deforming object, the solvers ([smoke solver|Node:dop/smokesolver], [fluid solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver], and [pyro solver|Node:dop/pyrosolver]) do not pay attention to the per-point deformation. You need to set the __Velocity Type__ to __Point Velocity__, which is a parameter on the __Fields > Sources__ subtab of the solvers.

== Using Source from X ==

    # Create an open geometry object within a container.
        For more information on containers see: [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox], [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Flamefront Container|firebox], and [Icon:SHELF/box_fluid][Liquid Container|liquidbox].

    # Select the geometry object to generate the source.

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source]__Source from Surface__ tool on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.

    # Select the container to put the source into and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

== Tips ==

* The default [Fluid Source surface node|Node:sop/fluidsource] includes noise to create more interesting fluids. You can edit the parameter on the Fluid Source node's __Noise__ tab to change the source behavior.

* To animate the source amount, keyframe the __Scale source volume__ parameter on the [Source Volume DOP|Node:dop/sourcevolume] in the DOP network.

* This tool is different than using [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_smoke][Smoke from Object|smokefromobject], [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fire][Burn from Object|burstintoflame], and [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fluid][Liquid from Object|liquidfromobject] because it emits fluid continuously.

    The "source from" tools let you create and simulate multiple objects in a container, whereas the "from object" tools set the initial conditions from one object.

* If the object is only partially inside the container, only the portion of the object inside the container's boundaries is simulated.
