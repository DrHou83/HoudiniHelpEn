= Screen Brush =

"""Lets you interactively groom hair in screen space."""

This tool allows you to interactively groom hair in screen space. It is typically used to give you finer control of the shape of your hair. This tool is different from [Icon:FUR/surface_brush][Surface Brush|/shelf/surfacebrush], as it allows for much more free-form grooming. The [Surface Brush|/shelf/surfacebrush] only allows you to groom along the surface of the geometry.
