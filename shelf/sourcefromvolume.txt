"""Continuously generates smoke, fire, or liquid from a volume object in a container."""

This tool can be applied, for example, to objects such as taps or candle wicks as it creates a continuous flow of fluid. This tool is similar to [Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface]. Both create a continuous flow of fluid; however, this tool is applied to closed volume objects. It will not work with open volume objects, such as grids or curves. 

Keep in mind, this tool generates volume based fluid, as opposed to the [Icon:DOP/particlefluidemitter][Emit Particle Fluid|emitparticlefluid] tool which generates particle based fluid.

TIP:
    If you are sourcing from an object that deforms, or collides with a deforming object, the solvers ([smoke solver|Node:dop/smokesolver], [fluid solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver], and [pyro solver|Node:dop/pyrosolver]) do not pay attention to the per-point deformation. You need to set the __Velocity Type__ to __Point Velocity__, which is a parameter on the __Fields > Sources__ subtab of the solvers.

== Using Source from Volume ==

    # Create a geometry object with a closed volume within a container.
        For more information on containers see: [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox], [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Flamefront Container|firebox], and [Icon:SHELF/box_fluid][Liquid Container|liquidbox].

    # Select the geometry object to generate the source.

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source]__Source from Volume__ tool on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.

    # Select the container to put the source into and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

NOTE:
    To turn off the continuous flow of fluid, set the __Activation__ to `0` on the [Source Relationship|Node:dop/sourcerel] node in the [AutoDopNetwork|Node:obj/dopnet]. You can [keyframe|/anim/basics] this parameter to control when the fluid is emitted.

This tool is different than using [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_smoke][Smoke from Object|smokefromobject], [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fire][Burn from Object|burstintoflame], and [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fluid][Liquid from Object|liquidfromobject] because it emits fluid continuously. It also useful as it allows you to create and simulate multiple objects in the container, whereas the other tools set the initial conditions from one object.

If the object is only partially in the container, only the portion of the object that is in the container's boundaries will be simulated.

This tool is similar to [Icon:SHELF/fluid_sink][Sink from Objects|sinkfromobjects] and [Icon:SHELF/fluid_pump][Pump from Objects|pumpfromobjects] as it converts a geometry object into a dynamic object with a [Icon:SOP/merge][Merge|Node:sop/merge] node that has a default Relationship. Changing the __Relationship__ field in the merge node will change the action of the tool. For example, you can change a [Icon:SHELF/fluid_sink][Sink from Object|/shelf/sinkfromobjects] to a [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source][Source from Volume|/shelf/sourcefromvolume] by changing the __Relationship__ from Sink Relationship to Source Relationship in the drop-down menu.

You can control the behavior of the fluid by editing the parameters of the fluid object. For more information on editing specific parameters, see the [Icon:DOP/smokeobject][Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] and [Icon:DOP/fluidobject][Fluid Object|Node:dop/fluidobject] node help.
    NOTE:
        Fire and smoke are both created by the [Icon:DOP/smokeobject][Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] node. They simply have different default parameters.
