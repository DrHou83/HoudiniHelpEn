= Fluid Force =

"""Applies forces to resist the current motion of dynamic objects relative to a fluid."""

This tool can be used to simulate the behavior of algae swaying in the underwater current, or the sail of a sunken ship.

    # Click the [Icon:DOP/fluidforce][Fluid Force|Node:dop/fluidforce] button on the __Drive Simulation__ tab.
    
    # Select the dynamic objects, typically [wires|/shelf/wireobject] and [cloth|/shelf/clothobject], whose motion to affect by fluids, and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Select the fluid object and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
