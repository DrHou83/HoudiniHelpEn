= Smooth Hair =

"""Lets you interactively smooth areas of hair."""

This tool allows you to interactively lengthen smooth areas of hair. This tool takes any hair that is inside the brush radius and lets you smooth it down. This is useful for areas of hair that are sticking out in an undesirable way.
