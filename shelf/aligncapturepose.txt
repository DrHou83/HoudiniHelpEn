= Align Capture Pose =

"""Match transforms on capture regions between the current animation and capture poses."""

The purpose of this tool is to reset the bone deformation on [bone captured geometry|capturegeometry]. This is necessary when you want to change the initial [Icon:OBJ_STATE/pose][pose|pose] of [Icon:OBJ_STATE/bones][bones|bones] that have already been
[Icon:SOP/capture][captured|capturegeometry].

Captured geometry is deformed when the current animation pose doesn't match the capture pose. So to reset the deformation, these poses need to match.  There are three methods offered by this tool depending on which pose should be modified to match the other one.

== Using Align Capture Pose ==

# Select the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/bones][bones|bones] whose capture regions you want to align.

# Click the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/aligncapturepose]Align Capture Pose tool on the __Rigging__ tab.

# Choose the alignment method on the menu above the viewport and press ((Enter)) to complete.

NOTE:
    Once the tool is invoked, it activates a state which will immediately align any bone you click on.

@parameters

Method:
    Specifies the alignment method.

    Match Capture Pose With Deform Region:
	    Sets the capture pose on bone objects such that they match the current pose of the bones' deform region.
	
    Match Bones With Capture Pose:
	    Sets the bone objects' transform parameters such that they match the bones' capture pose.

    Match Deform Region With Capture Pose:
	    Positions the bone objects' deform region to match the bones' capture pose. This doesn't change the bone transforms, but rather moves the deform region by setting the __Rig Adjustment__ parameters on the `cregion` nodes inside the bones.

<!--

The Align Capture Pose Operation allows you to synchronize the position
and orientation of the capture and the animation volumes of a capture
region.

After selecting your bones and right-clicking, the volumes will be
readjusted and synchronized to encompas the same space. Depending on the
menu choice, either the animation region is aligned with the capture
region or the capture region is aligned with the animation region.

Alingning animation volume with the capture volume is more common. This
operation is often needed when bone positions are tweaked to improve
animation. After an object has been captured, tweaking bones will cause
deformation of the geometry, however this deformation is not desirable
because it is not part of animation yet. It is rigging adjustment of the
initial skeletal configuration. To reset any deformations in these
cases, the Align Capture Pose tool can be used with the menu option set
to synchronize animation with capture.

Aligning capture volume with the animation volume is can be useful
before capturing an object if the animation pose is the desirable pose
for capturing. It can also be helpful for switching old hip files from
capture frame based to capture pose based workflow (though for changing
many capture region hscript command "bonealingcapture" is more
efficient).
