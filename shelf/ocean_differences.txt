=== Tank simulation ===


[Guided Ocean Layer Tank|/shelf/guidedoceanlayer]:
        Creates a layer of FLIP particles on the ocean surface. The layer of FLIP particles is sitting on a collision object that is more or less the shape of the ocean. Simulation only occurs in the top layer of the ocean surface. 
[Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank]:
        Fills the whole tank with FLIP Particles. Simulation occurs throughout the whole tank.
[Beach Tank|/shelf/beachtank]:
        Fills the whole tank with FLIP Particles, minus the terrain object. Simulation occurs throughout the whole tank.
[Flat Tank|/shelf/flattank]:
        Fills the whole tank with FLIP Particles. Simulation occurs throughout the whole tank.
[Ocean Flat Tank|/shelf/oceanflattank]:
        Fills the whole tank with FLIP Particles. Simulation occurs throughout the whole tank.

        
=== Waves ===

[Guided Ocean Layer|/shelf/guidedoceanlayer]:
        Pulls in velocities from the [ocean spectrum|Node:sop/oceanspectrum] node to create a constant wave simulation.
[Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank]:
        Only has the initial wave setup. After the initial frame, the simulation will begin to deviate from underlying ocean spectrum. However, the velocity applied at the simulation boundaries will maintain energy on the surface.
[Beach Tank|/shelf/beachtank]:
        Pulls in velocities from the [ocean spectrum|Node:sop/oceanspectrum] node to create directional waves across the length of the tank.
[Flat Tank|/shelf/flattank]:
        Does not start with any waves, but will react to objects that disturb it.
[Ocean Flat Tank|/shelf/oceanflattank]:
        Does not start with any waves, but will react to objects that disturb it.  The waves are added at render time.

=== Tracking ===

[Guided Ocean Layer|/shelf/guidedoceanlayer]:
        Can follow moving objects.
[Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank]:
        Can follow moving objects.
[Beach Tank|/shelf/beachtank]:
        Can not follow moving objects.
[Flat Tank|/shelf/flattank]:
        Can follow moving objects.
[Ocean Flat Tank|/shelf/oceanflattank]:
        Can follow moving objects.

=== When it is useful ===

[Guided Ocean Layer|/shelf/guidedoceanlayer]:
        Useful for shallow objects moving through the water, like a boat.
[Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank]:
        Useful for short ocean simulations where you don't need to control the shape or movement of the ocean.
[Beach Tank|/shelf/beachtank]:
        Useful for simulating waves breaking on a beach or other shallow water terrain.
[Flat Tank|/shelf/flattank]:
        Useful for any calm water simulations that don't require waves, or for simulations that are going to displace a lot of water, such as a whale moving around and jumping out of the water.
[Ocean Flat Tank|/shelf/oceanflattank]:
        Useful for simulations where the interacting objects are much bigger and/or faster than the wave motion, so the ocean displacement can be added as a post-process at render time.
