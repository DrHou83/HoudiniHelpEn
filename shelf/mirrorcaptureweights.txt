= Mirror Capture Weights =

"""Applies capture weights from one side of a geometry object to another."""

This tool saves you time because you can mirror the capture weights of [Icon:OBJ/bone][Bones|bones] and [Icon:OBJ/muscle][Muscles|muscle] on characters instead of creating them twice.

    # Click the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/mirrorcapture][Mirror Capture Weights|Node:sop/capturemirror] tool on the __Characters__ tab.
    
    # Select the destination points to mirror the capture weights to and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. 
        NOTE:
            You must include the symmetry points as well.
    
    # Select the source bones or muscles to mirror from and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    # Select the destination bones or muscles and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    The first image shows the capture weights before using the mirror tool. The second image shows the capture weights after using the mirror tool.
    
    NOTE:
        If you do not get the desired results, you can specify the exact bones or muscles to mirror to by clicking the __Spreadsheet__ button on the operation controls toolbar and choosing the corresponding bones or muscles in the drop-down menu.
            
        You can also choose the exact bones or muscles to mirror to by changing the __From__ and __To__ values in the parameter editor. The first item in the From list corresponds with the first item in the To list and so on.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/mirrorcapture][Mirror Capture Weights|/shelf/paintcapturelayer] on one side of a geometry, and
have those painted weights applied to the other side.

STEP 1

To perform this operation, you first select the points in your geometry that you wish to mirror. Only points from a single object can be chosen, and the chosen object must have either a [Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/deform] or have the `boneCapture` or `metaCapture` capture weight attributes. Once the points on this object are chosen, right-click to proceed.

STEP 2

The second step in this operation is to select the source bone or muscle
objects whose weights will be mirrored. When you complete the selection
of your points, all bones or muscles with non-zero weights on those
points are selected automatically. You can either use this default
selection, or modify it, then right-click to proceed. Only [bones|Node:obj/bone]
(objects that contain capture regions) and objects that contain
[metaballs|Node:sop/metaball] can be included in this selection.

STEP 3

The third step is to choose the destination [bones|Node:obj/bone] or [muscles|Node:obj/muscle] that will
receive the weights from the source bones or muscles selected in Step 2.
After selecting source bone or muscle objects, the set of destination
objects whose name match names of the source objects will be selected.
Matching is performed by trying to replace the prefix of the source
objects' names with a different prefix to generate the destination bone
names. This tool finds the shortest prefix possible to allow this
substitution. Again, you can either accept this default selection, or
modify the selection. Right-click to complete the operation.

A [Capture Mirror SOP|Node:sop/capturemirror] will be created in the object where you are
mirroring capture weights. The SOP will be created as the input to the
[Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/deform] if there is one, or as the end of the SOP
chain if there is no [Bone Deform SOP|Node:sop/deform]. You will be
presented with handles that allow you to define the plane through which
the capture weights are mirrored.
