= Fan =

"""Applies a conical fan wind to particles."""

This tool uses the [POP Fan|Node:dop/popfan] node to apply a wind field to particles matching a conical fan. The further away from the fan the particles are, the less they are affected by the force. For example, you could bind a fan to the front of an object and move it through particles to simulate something like a submarine moving through bubbles.

        # Click the [Icon:POP/fan][Fan|Node:dop/popfan] tool on the __Particles__ tab.
