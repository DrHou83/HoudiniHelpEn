= New Simulation =

"""Creates a new DOP Network."""

This tool creates a [Dynamics Network|Node:obj/dopnet] containing a [Icon:SOP/merge][Merge|Node:obj/dopnet] tool on the __Drive Simulation__ tab.

    NOTE:
        Simulation objects are created in the current simulation rather than in the AutoDopNetwork. However, the AutoDopNetwork is still created if there are no other [dynamics networks|Node:obj/dopnet] in the scene.

For specific parameter node help see the [Icon:DOP/makeactive][New Simulation|Node:obj/dopnet] help.
