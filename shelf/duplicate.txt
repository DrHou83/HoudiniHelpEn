= Duplicate =

"""Duplicates entire objects or geometry primitives."""

This tool is useful for duplicating objects that you have spent considerable time [modeling|/model/].

== Overview ==

Duplicate works at both the [Scene and Geometry levels|/basics/objects].

- At the Scene level, the duplicate tool creates new copies of the selected objects. Each duplicate is stored in its own geometry object.

- At the Geometry level, the tool creates a [Duplicate surface node|Node:sop/duplicate] which copies the selected geometry and places the result in a single geometry object.

In both cases, you can use the [transform handle|/basics/handles#basic-handles] to position the copies in the scene as desired.

== Using Duplicate == (includeme)

    At the Scene level:
    # Select the object(s) you want to duplicate.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/duplicate] Duplicate tool on the __Modify__ tab.
    
    At the Geometry level:
    # Select the curves and/or surfaces you want to duplicate.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/duplicate] Duplicate tool on the __Modify__ tab.
    
    NOTE:
        Duplicated geometry will appear directly on top of existing geometry.
