= Attach to Bones =

"""Connects muscles, muscle rigs, and pin anchors to other objects in your scene."""

This shelf tool allows you to quickly connect multiple muscles to common end point parents as a group rather than muscle by muscle.


== Using Attach to Bones == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/muscle_attach] __Attach to Bones__ tool on the __Muscles__ shelf tab.
    
    # Select the muscles, muscle rigs, and muscle pins to attach to the character rig and press ((Enter)). If you had any muscle components already selected before clicking this tool, you will skip this step.

    # Select the head anchor parent and press ((Enter)).  All selected muscles will share this common parent.

    # Select the tail anchor parent and press ((Enter)).  All selected muscles will share this common parent.
    
    NOTE:
	    The [Keep Position When Parenting|/basics/objects#parenting] toggle will compensate for a parent's transform when attaching or detaching an anchor to/from its parent.
