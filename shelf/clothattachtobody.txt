"""Creates constraints between a set of points on a cloth object and a point on the surface of a goal object."""

This is useful for attaching cloth to characters. It creates soft body constraints between a set of points on the constrained cloth object and barycentric coordinates, chosen by proximity, on a goal dynamics object. You select points on the constrained object and then, optionally, select a goal object and goal polygons. This tool will link each selected point on the target with the closest barycentric coordinates on the goal object.

The tool relies on the fact that the topology of the goal object stays the same during the simulation. The number of points or primitives on the goal object cannot change over time, otherwise the constraints will not work properly.

    :task:Create new cloth constraints:
	# Click the [Icon:DOP/clothattachtobody] Attach Cloth to Body tool on the __Cloth__ shelf.
    
	# Select the cloth object you want to constrain, then press ((Enter)).

	# Select the points to constrain on the selected cloth object, then press ((Enter)).

	# Select the goal object you want to constrain to, then press ((Enter)). If nothing is selected, the tool will constrain to internal animation.
    
	# Select polygons on the goal object, if you want to restrict the closest-point selection domain, then press ((Enter)). If nothing is selected, the tool will constrain to the closest of all the goal object's points.
    
    NOTE:
	This tool will create a soft constraint by default. You can change it to a hard constraint in the __Type__ dropdown menu on the __Operation Controls__ toolbar.
