= Paint Tearable =

"""This tool lets you paint your cloth object to determine where the object will come apart once the tear threshold is exceeded."""

This tool is useful for simulating objects that tear, such as a paper. By default, objects will tear if the __Stiffness__ of the __Stretch__, __Shear__, or __Bend__ exceeds 10% of the __Tear Threshold__. You can use this tool on any cloth object. For more information on cloth dynamics see [cloth simulation|/dyno/cloth].

NOTE:
    This tool only works on polygonal geometry.

== Using Paint Tearable ==

# Create an object to tear and turn it into a [Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject].

# Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/resimulate_inactive] brain icon in the bottom right corner of Houdini to turn off the simulation. 

    NOTE:
        Once you turn off this option the icon will change to a "do not" [Icon:COMMON/delete] symbol.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/painttearable] Paint Tearable tool on the __Cloth__ tab of the shelf.

# Select the object you want to paint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. 

    TIP:
        Pressing ((W)) in the viewport to change the view to wireframe, and [Icon:VIEW/display_points] displaying points will make painting easier.

# Drag the [brush|/basics/brush] over the points to paint them. The object will tear in the painted areas once it reaches the tear threshold.

    TIP:
        You can change the __Radius__ of your brush by holding ((Shift + LMB)) and dragging or by changing the value in the Operation Controls toolbar. You can also alter the __Opacity__ in the Operation Controls toolbar.

# Click the "do not" [Icon:COMMON/delete] icon in the bottom right corner of Houdini to turn the simulation back on.
