= Glue Wire to Animation =

"""Constraints a wire point to a certain position and direction."""

This involves constraining some point on the [Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject]
to its animated location and orientation.

This node is useful when simulating hair or fur by letting you anchor the
hair or fur.

== How To ==

# Select the Glue Wire to Animation shelf tool

# Select the point on the wire object that you wan to constrain, then press enter

NOTE:
    This shelf tool creates a constraint network in the main DOP simulation node.
    It also creates a SOP Network node inside the DOP network that builds the
    geometry for the constraint network.
