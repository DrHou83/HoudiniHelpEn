= UV Flatten =

"""Creates flattened pieces in texture space from 3D geometry."""

== Using UV Flatten == (includeme)
    
	# Select the primitives (faces) you want to add UV coordinates to.
	
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/uvflatten][UV Flatten|Node:sop/uvflatten] tool on the __Texture__ tab.

    # Select the edges to use as seams, and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    TIP:
        In the viewer, press ((Space + 5)) to switch to "UV Viewport" to see the flattened texture pieces.

    NOTE:
        To draw the default pins when the tool is active, set the node to
        export an __Active Pin Group__.

    :task:Move a pin:
        Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/uv_pin_move] "Manipulate pins" button in the toolbar. Select a pin or multiple pins to move, and drag.
		
		While you move one or more pins, the node maintains the positions of unselected pins and (as much as possible) the shape of the piece. So, if you have two pins, you can rotate and scale a piece by selecting one and moving it around the other.
            
    :task:Add a pin:
        Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/uv_pin_add] "Pin vertices" button in the toolbar. Select the vertex or vertices you want to pin and press ((Enter)).
	
	:task:Delete a pin:
		Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/uv_pin_move] "Manipulate pins" button in the toolbar. select the pin and press ((Delete)).

    :task:Cut an edge:
        Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/uv_edge_cut] "Cut edges" button in the toolbar, select the edges, and press ((Enter)) to confirm the selection.
	
	:task:Visualize distortions:
		Right-click the [Icon:VIEW/visualization] Visualization icon on the right side of the viewport and select __UV Distortions__. This will shade your geometry red when it is stretched and blue when it is squeezed.
	
    TIP:
        Once your texture pieces are unwrapped, you can use the [UV Layout node|Node:sop/uvlayout] to change the packing of the pieces.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/uvflatten][UV Flatten|Node:sop/uvflatten] node help.
