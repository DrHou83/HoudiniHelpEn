== Using Configure Joints ==

    # Click the Configure Joints tool on the __Crowds__ tab.
    # Select the agent primitive to configure rotation limits for and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    # Left click on a joint marker to configure its rotation limits. Use the cone handle to adjust the rotation range, and use the cone orientation handle ( ((O)) ) to adjust the overall alignment of the cone. If necessary, use the child orientation handle ( ((Shift+O)) ) to adjust the alignment of the twist axis for the child transform. Press ((Delete)) to remove the configuration of the selected joint.
    # Move the display flag to the [Node:sop/testsim_ragdoll] node and click [Icon:PLAYBAR/play_forward] [play|/anim/playbar] to see the effect of the rotation limits on the ragdoll's behavior.
