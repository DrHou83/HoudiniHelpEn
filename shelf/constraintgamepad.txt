"""Drive an object using a game controller device."""

This is used to constrain an object (camera) to be driven via a game controller device.

== Using the Gamepad Constraint ==

There are two ways to use this constraint.

Through the shelf tool:

# Click the [Icon:CHOP/gamepad] Gamepad tool on the __Constraints__ tab.

# Select the object you want drive using gamepad and press ((Enter)) to confirm
  your selection.

Through the object's menu:

# Select the desired object to control with gamepad.

# Click the [Icon:NETWORKS/chop] button after the `constraints_path` parameter.

# In the dropdown menu, click the [Icon:CHOP/gamepad] button.

NOTE:   
    This tool creates a new `constraints` CHOP Network inside the object.
