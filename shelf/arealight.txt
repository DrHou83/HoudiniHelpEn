"""Simulates a light in the shape of a line, rectangle, disk, or sphere."""

This tool creates an [Light object|Node:obj/hlight] and sets the
__Light type__ parameter to "Grid".

You can change the area light shape by changing the __Light type__ parameter. Use the __Area size__ parameter to set the size of the light.

Line:
    Lights are distributed along the length of a straight
    line.

Sphere:
    Lights are distributed along the outside surface of a
    sphere.

    You can put objects inside this shape for an overall soft shadow look that is similar to global illumination irradiance.
