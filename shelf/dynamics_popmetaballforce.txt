= Metaball Force =

"""Applies forces according to metaballs."""

This tool applies a force to particles according to how close they are to metaballs. It puts down a [POP Metaball Force|Node:dop/popmetaballforce] in the DOP network, and also a [Force SOP|Node:sop/force] in the SOP network.

== Using Metaball Force == (includeme)

        # Create some metaballs using the [Icon:SOP/metaball][Metaball|/shelf/metaball] shelf tool.
        
        # Create a particle system using the [Icon:POP/location][Location|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] or [Icon:POP/source][Source|/shelf/dynamics_popsource] shelf tools.
        
        # Click the [Icon:SOP/force][Metaball Force|Node:dop/popmetaballforce] tool on the __Particles__ tab.
        
        # Select the metaballs you want to affect your [particles|/dopparticles/] and press ((Enter)).
        
        You can set the __Force Scale__ parameter on the [Metaball Force|Node:dop/popmetaballforce] node to either attract or repel particles. A positive value will attract particles and a negative value will repel particles. 
        
        By default, this tool applies a __Radial Force__, which can be changed to __Directional Force__ on the [Force SOP|Node:sop/force]. There are also force controls for axial, vortex, and spiral forces.
                
        The following example shows the metaballs repelling the particles.
