"""Slices a particle fluid across an arbitrary plane for distribution to a simulation farm."""

See [how to distribute a particle fluid simulation|/dyno/distribute] for more information.

    # Click the [Icon:DOP/sliceplane] Slice tool on the __Particle fluids__ tab.
    
    # Select the particle fluid you want to slice, or select a previous slice to create a sub-slice, then press ((Enter)).
    
        If you select the fluid as the "parent" of the slice, the plane slices through the entire particle fluid. If you select a previous slice, the plane slices through the sub-region in which you place the plane.
        
        For example:
        
        [Image:/images/shelf/slice_parenting_1.png] |
            Add a horizontal slice through a particle fluid.
        [Image:/images/shelf/slice_parenting_2.png] |
            The slice divides the particle fluid into two regions. Now if you add a vertical slice you have two options:
        [Image:/images/shelf/slice_parenting_3a.png] |
            If you select the fluid as the parent for the vertical slice, the two slices intersect, creating four regions.
        [Image:/images/shelf/slice_parenting_3b.png] |
            If you select the horizontal slice as the parent for the vertical slice, the vertical slice will divide one of the sub-regions created by the horizontal slice. Whether the vertical slice divides the region above or below the horizontal slice depends on where you position the slice handle.
    
    # Use the handle in the viewer or the parameters in the parameter editor to position and rotate the slice plane.
