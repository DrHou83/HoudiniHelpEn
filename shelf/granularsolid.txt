"""Fills an object loosely with grains and creates constraints to hold it together into one object."""

This tool fills an object loosely with grains and creates constraints to hold it together into one object. It is similar to [Dry Sand|/shelf/drysand] and [Wet Sand|/shelf/wetsand]. However, instead of filling an object with unconstrained independent grains, all of the grains are constrained to each other to maintain the distance between each particle. It creates actual bonds that either always stay together, or can be torn apart. 

The controls in the __Explicit Constrains__ section of the [POP Grains|Node:dop/popgrains] node can be used to change the behavior of the grains. The default result is a soft and bouncy object that does not break apart. However, by turning on the __Break Constraints__ checkbox and setting a __Break Threshold__, this tool can be use to create wet sand objects that break apart when forces are applied, like a sand castle. 

This tool can be thought of as a simple FEM solver. It results in solid-like behavior because there are no collisions between particles since they are all right next to each other and constrained. Like FEM, you can use Granular Solid to simulation disintegrating soft bodies. Granular Solid may run faster, but have less realistic, more bouncy results.

NOTE:
        This shelf tool puts down a [Point Deform SOP|Node:sop/pointdeform] in the geometry network, to allow the skin to deform with the grains. It deforms the high resolution mesh according to the animated low resolution mesh.

== Using Granular Solid == (includeme)

    # Select the geometry object to convert to a Granular Solid object.
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/sandobject][Granular Solid|Node:dop/popgrains] tool on the __Grains__ tab.
    
    The following are a couple of examples of things you can use the Granular Solid tool for.

For specific parameter information, see the [POP Grains|Node:dop/popgrains] help.
    
NOTE:
        Scaling is an issue for sand because the number of grains are based on how many particles are around it. Changing resolutions may change results.

== Tips ==

The following parameters in the __Explicit Constraints__ section of the [POP Grains|Node:dop/popgrains] node will allow you to change the behavior of the grains.

:task: Make objects break apart:
        Enable the __Break Constraints__ checkbox and set a __Break Threshold__. If the constraints stretch beyond the threshold, the bonds will break apart. The __Break Threshold__ is a percentage of the rest length.

:task: Make the object less bouncy:
        Increase the __Stiffness__ parameter. This will control how stiff the bonds between particles are.
