"""Generates particles from incoming particles."""

This tool is useful for producing secondary effects such as smoke from fire. How often and how many times particles are replicated can be controlled on the __Birth__ tab of the [POP Replicate|Node:dop/popreplicate] node.

    # Create a [Icon:SOP/particle][particle system|/dopparticles/] using the [Icon:POP/location][Location|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] or [Icon:POP/source][Source|/shelf/dynamics_popsource] shelf tools.
    
    # Click [Icon:POP/split][Replicate|Node:dop/popreplicate] on the __Particles__ tab. 
    
            The particle system will attach itself to the particle system you have selected.
    
    # Click [Icon:PLAYBAR/play_forward] play on the [playbar|/anim/playbar] to see the particles.
