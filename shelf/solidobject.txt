"""Creates a solid finite element (FEM) object that is not very elastic and does not fracture."""

This tool creates a [Solid Object node|Node:dop/solidobject] in the current simulation and sets it up to import from the selected object.
See [solid (FEM) simulation|/dyno/solids] for more information.

== Creating a solid object == (includeme)

    # Select the geometry to convert to a solid object.
    
    # On the __Solid__ tab, click the [Icon:VOP/concrete] Solid Object tool.
    
    NOTE:
        Once you convert geometry to a solid object, you can only transform, rotate, and scale it at the first frame.

For parameter help see the [Solid Object node|Node:dop/solidobject] help.
