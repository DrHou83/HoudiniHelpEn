= Paint Bend Noise =

"""Interactively changes the bend noise of fur by painting your geometry."""

This tool is useful for interactively modifying the bend noise of fur. It
allows you to manually paint the bend noise of fur on the skin geometry.

This tool works independently of the [Paint Fur Bend|/shelf/paintfurbend] tool. The amount of bending is basically the sum of the comb and bend values, multiplied by a per hair random number. 

After adding fur with the [Icon:FUR/add_fur][Add Fur|addfur] tool, use the
[Icon:FUR/comb][Comb Fur|combfur] tool and some of the paint tools to style
the fur.  Finally, use the [Icon:FUR/add_dynamics][Add Dynamics|furdynamics]
tool to make the fur react to the character's motion and external forces.

TIP:
    You should use the comb tool before using the bend tools, because they depend on the combed direction. Both influence how much a hair arcs towards the combed direction. 

== Using Paint Bend Noise == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/paint_bend_noise][Paint Bend Noise|paintfurbendnoise] tool on the __Fur__ tab.

    # Select the fur object to paint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
        NOTE:
            Modify the __FG__ multiplier field to increase or decrease the amount of bend noise to paint. A value of 0 will remove all bend noise, 1 will not change the amount of bend noise, and anything larger than 1 will increase the amount of bend noise.

    # Drag the [brush|/basics/brush] over the surface to paint it.
    
        NOTE:
            You can change the __Radius__ of your brush by holding ((Shift + LMB)) and dragging or by changing the value in the Operation Controls toolbar. You can also alter the __Opacity__ in the Operation Controls toolbar.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/paint][Paint|Node:sop/paint] node help.

NOTE:
    The parameters on this tool are associated with the parameters on the __Hairs__ > __Guide__ > __Bend__ tab of the [Fur Object|Node:obj/fur]. The __Bend Noise__ parameter on this tab scales the effect of the Paint Bend Noise tool. There are also parameters for further customization, such as __Bend Noise Map__ that will that will allow you to use texture maps.

== Tips ==

Houdini will recook each time a brush stroke is made. To improve responsiveness while painting, reduce the __Display Density__ on the __Basic__ tab of the [Icon:SOP/fur][Fur Object|Node:obj/fur]. If this does not speed up Houdini enough, you can turn off the __Display__ checkbox which will disable the display of hairs for improved responsiveness while you paint the geometry. 

If you simply want to turn off the display of hairs for a moment when painting, you can hide other objects in the viewport by clicking [Icon:VIEW/show_all] in the viewer toolbar and selecting __Hide Other Objects__. This has the same effect on performance as turning off the __Display__ checkbox on the fur object. Once you are done painting you can click [Icon:VIEW/show_all] and choose __Show All Objects__ to display the fur again.

Once you paint bend noise, you may want to use some of the other paint tools to style the fur, such as: [Paint Fur Density|/shelf/paintfurdensity], [Paint Fur Length|/shelf/paintfurlength], [Paint Clumping|/shelf/paintfurclumping], [Paint Base Color|/shelf/paintbasecolor], [Paint White Hair Density|/shelf/paintwhitehairdensity], [Paint Guard Hair Density|/shelf/paintguardhairdensity], or [Paint Guard Hair Length|/shelf/paintguardhairlength].

You may also want to use the [Icon:FUR/add_dynamics][Add Dynamics|furdynamics]
tool to make the fur react to the character's motion and external forces.
