= Detach from Bones =

"""Disconnects muscle, muscle rig, and pin anchors from other objects in your scene."""

This shelf tool allows you to quickly disconnect (unparent) multiple muscles and rigs from any anchor parents as a group rather than muscle by muscle.


== Using Detach from Bones == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/muscle_detach] __Detach from Bones__ tool on the __Muscles__ shelf tab.

    # Select the muscles, muscle rigs, and muscle pin objects you would like to detach and press ((Enter)). If you had any muscle components already selected before clicking this tool, you will skip this step.

    NOTE:
        The [Keep Position When Parenting|/basics/objects#parenting] toggle will compensate for a parent's transform when attaching or detaching an anchor to/from its parent.

For more information, the [muscle workflow|/character/muscles] help page.
