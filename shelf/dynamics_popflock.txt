= Flock =

"""Applies a flocking algorithm to particles."""

This tool uses the [POP Flock|Node:dop/popflock] node to apply a flocking algorithm to particles. This tool can be used to simulate a swarm of bees chasing a character, or a flock of birds in the sky.

You can choose the __Number of Centers__ on the [POP Flock|Node:dop/popflock] node to determine how many different clusters of particles are formed. You can also the modify the parameters on the  __Interaction Force__ tab to control how much they stay together and how far apart they can get.

== Using Flock == (includeme)

        # Create a particle system along the curve using the [Icon:POP/location][Location|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] or [Icon:POP/source][Source|/shelf/dynamics_popsource] shelf tools.
        
        # Click the [Icon:POP/follow][Flock|Node:dop/popflock] tool on the __Particles__ tab.

        TIP:
                To create more realistic simulations, do not continuously birth particles. You can also add some noise with a [POP Force|Node:dop/popforce] node for a more natural look.

        NOTE:
                To move the flocks, you can use a [POP Attract|Node:dop/popattract] node to have them follow an object (such as a character), or use other [POP Forces|Node:dop/popforce] to direct them.
