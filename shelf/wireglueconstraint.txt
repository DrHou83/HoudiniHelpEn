= Wire Glue Constraint =

"""Creates a pin constraint and an angular constraint so that the object is pinned to a point in space, and is unable to rotate."""

You need to create a [Icon:DOP/wireobject][Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject] before you can use this tool. This tool is useful, for example, for simulating a tree rooted to the ground. The glue constraint makes the wire stiffer than a pin constraint.

    # Click the [Icon:DOP/wireglueconstraint][Wire Glue Constraint|Node:dop/wireglueconstraint] tool on the __Wires__ tab.
        
    # Select the dynamic object or points to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        NOTE:
            If you select the whole object, the constraint will be placed at the root of the object.
