= RBD Auto Freeze =

"""Automatically freezes RBD Objects that have come to rest."""

The RBD Auto Freeze tool provides an easy way to freeze down elements of
an RBD simulation that have come to a rest. Frozen RBD Object will continue to support other RBD objects, but will no longer move as a result of collisions. This allows for faster processing and ensures that no jittering will occur.

== Using RBD Auto Freeze ==

# Select the [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] to add auto freeze to.

# Click the [Icon:DOP/rbdautofreeze][RBD Auto Freeze|Node:dop/rbdautofreeze] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab of the shelf and press ((Enter)).
