"""Creates a force that pushes away from the selected object. This lets you expand (blow up) a fluid system at a specific time in a specific shape, which is useful for explosions."""

(Technically, the expansive force is a _divergence field_.)

See [fluid sourcing|/dyno/fluid_sourcing] for information on how the tool transforms the input object into a source for the effect.

== Using Expand from Objects ==

:task:Create a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox], [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Flamefront Container|firebox], and [Icon:SHELF/box_fluid][Liquid Container|liquidbox].

:task:Fill a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/source_from_surface][Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface], [Icon:SHELF/source_from_points][Source from Points|sourcefrompoints], and [Icon:SHELF/source_from_volume][Source from Volume|sourcefromvolume].

:task:Create an expansion force:
    # Select the object you want to turn into an expansion field.
    
    # On the __Populate containers__ tab, click the [Icon:SHELF/expand_from_objects] Expand from Objects tool.
    
    # Select the fluid container you want to expand in and press ((Enter)).

:task:Control the amount of expansion:
    In the DOP network, find the Source Volume node importing the divergence field (named `source_divergence_from_<<object>>`).
    
    Use the __Scale source volume__ parameter to control the amount of expansion. You can keyframe this value to delay and/or limit the expansion time, pulse the expansion, etc.
    
    Sometimes very high values may be necessary (100+) to have visible effects.

== Tips ==

* The shelf tool adds a [Fluid Source surface node|Node:sop/fluidsource] to the object to convert its geometry into an appropriate volume, then imports the volume into the DOP network using a [Source Volume node|Node:dop/sourcevolume].

* Most "populate containers" defaults are configured for a sphere with a radius of 1 unit. For much smaller or larger volumes, you may need to change settings on the [Fluid Source surface node|Node:sop/fluidsource] created by the shelf tool. The __Sample Radius__, __Edge Location__ and __Feather Length__ parameters give extensive control over how everything is sampled into a volume.
