= RBD Sphere Objects =

"""Creates a number of rigid bodies from SOP geometry, which use proxy geometry composed of adaptively-sized spheres."""

This tool uses [Node:sop/vdbtospheres] to generate proxy geometry for the RBD objects.
A compound collision shape built from many spheres can be much faster to simulate, particularly for concave geometry.

== Using RBD Sphere Objects == (includeme)

    # Select the geometry to convert to an RBD sphere object.

    # Optionally, define the pieces to be fractured. For example, using the [Shatter tool|/shelf/shatter].

    # Click the [Icon:DOP/rbdsphereobject][Shelf:rbdsphereobject] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

    # Modify the parameters of the [Node:sop/vdbfrompolygons] SOP and the [Node:sop/vdbtospheres] SOP, if necessary, to adjust the voxel size used and the maximum number of generated spheres.

    # Switch the display flag to the [Node:sop/xformpieces] SOP to see the original geometry transformed based on the motion of the proxy objects.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/rbdpackedobject][RBD Packed Object|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject] or [Icon:COMMON/openvdb][VDB to Spheres|Node:sop/vdbtospheres] help.
