"""Generates node networks to create a half-filled box of FLIP fluid material, with proper boundary conditions to contain the fluid in the box."""

    #id: 116176349

NOTE:
    This tool does not actually create a FLIP fluid tank object you can manipulate. It generates several node networks that together create the fluid box. To edit various aspects of the fluid tank, you will need to jump between different networks and nodes.

== How to ==

:task:Create a FLIP fluid tank:
    # On the __Particle Fluids__ tab, click [Icon:SHELF/flip_tank] __Flip Tank__.
    
    # In the viewport, click to place the tank. You can hold ((Alt)) to move up and down from the construction plane. Press ((Enter)) to place the box at the origin.
    
    TIP:
        You can ((Ctrl))-click the tool to automatically create the tank at the origin.

:task:Resize the tank:
    # In the [network editor|/network/], go up to the Scene level, then double-click the `fluidtank_initial` object to go inside.
    
    # Click the `fluidbounds` node.
    
    # Use the handles in the viewport or the parameters in the parameter editor to change the size of the box.

:task:Change the fluid level:
    # In the [network editor|/network/], go up to the Scene level, then double-click the `fluidtank_initial` object to go inside.
    
    # Click the `waterlevel` node.
    
    # In the viewport, drag the red rings to move the water level up or down, or edit the __Distance__ parameter.
