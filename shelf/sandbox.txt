= Sand Box =

"""Creates a patch of sand with a collision object which contains the sand."""

This tool creates a patch of sand with a collision object which contains the sand. You can either create a sand box using a terrain object as the surface, or if you don't select an object to use as the surface, this tool will use a default grid. You would typically want to use this tool any time you want to start with a container of sand rather than an object made of sand. For example, when simulating a desert, an actual sandbox, or a patch of ground as sand.

== Using Sand Box ==

# Create a terrain object to be used as the surface of the sand.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/sandbox]__Sand Box__ tool on the Grains tab. 

For specific parameter information, see the [Extrude Volume|Node:sop/extrudevolume] and [Grain Source|Node:sop/grainsource] help pages.

== How to change the look of your sand box ==

:task: Control how deep the sand box will be:
    Modify the __Depth__ parameter on the [Extrude Volume|Node:sop/extrudevolume] SOP. It controls how far below the surface sand will be generated.
    
:task:Prevent sand from falling out of the sand box when it is moved around:
    Use the __Base Lift__ parameter on the  [Extrude Volume|Node:sop/extrudevolume] SOP. It controls how far above the surface the sand box will extend.

:task: Change the shape of the container walls:
    Increase the __Base Padding__ parameter on the [Extrude Volume|Node:sop/extrudevolume] SOP. This parameter causes the sand box to taper outward from the base. This can be used to help hide the sides of the container, and is useful because sand will collide with the edges and slide down in a more natural way than it would with perfectly vertical walls.
