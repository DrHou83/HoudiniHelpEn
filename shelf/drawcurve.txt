= Draw Curve =

"""Allows you to draw a curve freehand in space or on an object."""

The Draw Curve allows freehand drawing of curves in the viewport. Different projection options allow the curve to be snapped to either a construction plane or a collision geometry. 

NOTE:
        Drawing with a stylus input device will account for pressure and tilt.
