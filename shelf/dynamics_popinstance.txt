= Instance Geometry on Particles =

"""Lets you instance geometry on particles."""

This tool uses the [POP Instance|Node:dop/popinstance] node to set up the `instancepath` for particles, allowing them to be rendered with point instancing.

The guide geometry for this node is created by the [POP Object|Node:dop/popobject], which is where you can disable it or change its default color.
