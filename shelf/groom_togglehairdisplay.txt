= Toggle Hair Display =

"""Turns the display flag of the Hair Generate object on and off."""

This tool toggles the display of any generated hair that is selected or that is referencing a current or selected node. This also works when you are inside a referenced node. 

Turning off the display of the [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen] object disables hair generation in the viewport, and is useful for speeding up manipulation or simulation of guides.

For more information, see [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen].
