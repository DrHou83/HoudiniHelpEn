"""Creates an ocean like surface."""

This tool is useful for creating an ocean like surface. However, it is not a simulation, it is a deformer that does not use DOPs at all. You can scrub through the timeline and watch the ocean evolve without any simulation. This is useful if you want to have an ocean in the background of your shot, because it can bake out texture maps representing the ocean wave displacement, and can loop a wave set over time. For a simulated ocean, use the tools on the __Oceans__ shelf tab.
    
== Using Ocean Wave ==
    
    # Create the geometry you want to animate using ocean waves, for example a [Grid|Node:sop/grid].

        This geometry should be in "rest" space, with points at `y = 0` representing the ocean surface.

    # Select the geometry. In the __Deform__ shelf tab, click [Icon:SHELF/oceanwaves] Waves.
    
        The tool will create and wire the [Ocean Spectrum|Node:sop/oceanspectrum] and [Ocean Evaluate|Node:sop/oceanevaluate] nodes necessary to control the shape and movement of the ocean.
        
    # The animation is driven by the __Time__ parameter on the Ocean Evaluate node. The default expression is `$T` (the current time). You can edit this expression to change the animation direction and speed (for example, `$T * 2` to make the ocean move twice as fast).
