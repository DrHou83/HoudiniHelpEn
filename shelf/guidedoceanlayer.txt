"""Creates a FLIP fluid simulation that simulates a thin layer of the ocean surface."""

This tool creates a guided FLIP simulation of a thin particle layer on top of an ocean surface. The particles are initialized with ocean velocities. The ocean surface at a specified depth acts as a collision layer underneath the particles, allowing the particles to closely match the ocean waves. A _boundary layer_ of particles suppresses reflections at the edge of the tank, contributes ocean velocities back to the simulation, and maintains the water volume level to match the ocean. The FLIP Simulation uses a _guiding volume_ approach to maintain ocean velocities through the simulation.

The thickness of the thin layer will determine how closely the simulation matches the underlying ocean surface. The thickness will also determine how well the simulation can capture motion below the surface such as wakes and vortices.

The Guided Ocean Layer can be a static simulation or can follow a moving object through the ocean.

The [Ocean Spectrum|Node:sop/oceanspectrum] node allows you to shape the initial frame of your simulated ocean, and [Ocean Source|Node:sop/oceansource] controls the outputs.

== Using Guided Ocean Layer ==
    
# Click the [Icon:SHELF/guided_ocean_layer] __Guided Ocean Layer__ tool on the __Oceans__ tab to create a tank.  

# Select an animated object to follow and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. If no object is selected, you will be prompted to place a static tank.

NOTE:
    The layer for free fluid particles between the ocean surface and the guiding volume is controlled by the __Layer Size__ parameter in the [Ocean Source SOP|Node:sop/oceansource].
    
For specific parameter information, see the [Ocean Source|Node:sop/oceansource] help page.
