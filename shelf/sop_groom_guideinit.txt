= Initialize Guides =

"""Gives the guides an initial direction."""

Gives the guides an initial direction using a wind force, a direction based on the UV coordinates of the skin mesh, or a combination of the two. This is a quick way of starting off a groom and can help take some of the work out of initial guide grooming.

== Using Initialize Guides == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/initialize_guides][Initialize Guides|Node:sop/guideinit] tool on the __Grooming__ tab.

    # Select the groom objects you want to set the direction for and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    This tool will put down a [Guide Initialize SOP|Node:sop/guideinit] where you can change the default wind and UV parameters.
