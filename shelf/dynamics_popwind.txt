= Wind on Particles =

"""Applies wind to particles."""

Unlike [POP Force|Node:dop/popforce], which continuously accelerates particles, [POP Wind|Node:dop/popwind] acts as a drag pulling particles to the ambient wind speed.

        # Click the [Icon:POP/wind][Wind on Particles|Node:dop/popwind] button on the __Particles__ shelf tab.

                The Wind POP simulates a pushing force like wind, that can increase the velocity of particles but not past its own speed.
        
        # Set the __Wind Velocity__ to control the direction and magnitude of the wind, and the __Air Resistance__ to control the intensity of the wind on the [POP Wind|Node:dop/popwind] node.
