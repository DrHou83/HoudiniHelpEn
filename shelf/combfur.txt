= Comb Fur =

"""Change the direction of hairs by painting."""

Use this tool to change the direction of hairs in [fur|/fur]. Rarely do individual strands of hair stand straight up. Brushing them around gives the fur a more natural look.

After adding fur with the [Icon:FUR/add_fur][Add Fur|addfur] tool, use the
[Icon:FUR/comb][Comb Fur|combfur] tool and some of the paint tools to style
the fur.  Finally, use the [Icon:FUR/add_dynamics][Add Dynamics|furdynamics]
tool to make the fur react to the character's motion and external forces. When the character animates the fur gets transformed by the way the character moves.

NOTE:
    The combed direction affects the bend and twist results, so combing should be done before either of those operations.  

TIP:
    The density values (fur density, white hair density, guard density) affect the distribution of hairs.  If the position of existing hairs is important, you may want to use a texture map instead of the paint tools to further adjust the density. 

== Using Comb Fur == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/comb][Comb Fur|combfur] tool on the __Fur__ tab.

    # Set the __Comb Lift__, __Radius__, __UV Radius__, and __Opacity__ on the operation controls toolbar.
    
        NOTE:
            You can change the __Radius__ of your brush by holding ((Shift + LMB)) and dragging or by changing the value in the Operation Controls toolbar.
            
    # Hold and drag your cursor over the vector attributes you want to comb. 
    
        You can turn on the  __Show Guide Geometry__ checkbox in the Operation Controls toolbar if you want to display the guides.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/comb][Comb|Node:sop/comb] node help. For general brush information see the [Brush tool|/basics/brush] help.

TIP:
    One parameter that you may want to adjust first is the __Comb Noise__ parameter on the __Hairs__ > __Guide__ > __Comb__ tab of the [Fur Object|Node:obj/fur]. 

    You may also want to use the [Paint Bend|/shelf/paintfurbend] and [Paint Twist|/shelf/paintfurtwist] tools on the __Fur__ shelf to adjust the style of the combed fur.

== Tips ==

Houdini will recook each time a brush stroke is made. To improve responsiveness while combing, reduce the __Display Density__ on the __Basic__ tab of the [Icon:SOP/fur][Fur Object|Node:obj/fur]. If this does not speed up Houdini enough, you can turn off the __Display__ checkbox which will disable the display of hairs for improved responsiveness while you paint the geometry.

If you simply want to turn off the display of hairs for a moment when combing, you can hide other objects in the viewport by clicking [Icon:VIEW/show_all] in the viewer toolbar and selecting __Hide Other Objects__. This has the same effect on performance as turning off the __Display__ checkbox on the fur object. Once you are done painting you can click [Icon:VIEW/show_all] and choose __Show All Objects__ to display the fur again.
	    
Once you comb the fur, you may want to use some of the paint tools to style the fur. You can paint attributes such as:[density|/shelf/paintfurdensity], [length|/shelf/paintfurlength], [clumping|/shelf/paintfurclumping], [base color|/shelf/paintbasecolor], [frizz|/shelf/paintfurfrizz], [white hair density|/shelf/paintwhitehairdensity], [guard hair density|/shelf/paintguardhairdensity], and [guard hair length|/shelf/paintguardhairlength].
