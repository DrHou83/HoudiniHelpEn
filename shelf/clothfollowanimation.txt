"""Attach piece of cloth to its internal animation."""

This tool creates soft body constraints that attach to the cloth object's internal animation. 

Another use for this tool is to re-attach existing constraints. You can select an existing constraint during the first step in which case the tool will become a re-attachment tool.

== Manipulating constraints in the viewport ==
    :task:Create new cloth constraints:
	# Click the [Icon:SHELF/cloth_follow_animation] Follow Target tool on the __Cloth__ or __Solid__ shelf.
    
	# Select the cloth object you want to constrain, then press ((Enter)).

	# Select the points on the selected object you want to constrain, then press ((Enter)).

    :task:Re-attach existing constraints:
	# Click the [Icon:SHELF/cloth_follow_animation] Follow Target tool on the __Cloth__ shelf.
    
	# Select the constraint(s) you want to re-attach, then press ((Enter)).
    
    NOTE:
	This tool will create a spring SBD constraint by default. You can change it to a pin constraint in the __Type__ dropdown menu on the __Operation Controls__ toolbar.
