= Attach Constraint to Animation =

"""Connects an existing soft body constraint to the object's animation."""

You need to create a soft body object ([wire|/shelf/wireobject] or [cloth|/shelf/clothobject]) and attach a [constraint|Node:dop/conrelationship] to it before you can use this tool. Typically you will have [animated|/anim] the new host object (e.g. the skin) prior to creating the soft body object (e.g. the [fur|/fur]). This tool is useful, for example, to simulate hair attached to a moving
[character|/character/].

== Using Attach Constraint to Animation ==

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/attach_constraint_animation] Attach Constraint to Animation tool on the __Wires__ or __Cloth__ tab.

# Select the constraint to parent and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

This example shows a polygonal [Icon:SOP/sphere][sphere|/shelf/sphere] with primitive normals turned on. The [sphere|/shelf/sphere] is given some [animation|/anim], converted to a [Icon:DOP/wireobject][wire object|/shelf/wireobject], given [constraint|Node:dop/conrelationship], and the constraints are attached to the animation. When the simulation plays,
the "hair" moves with the sphere as it rotates.
