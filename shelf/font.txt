    :task:Place the font object anywhere in the scene:
        # Click the [Icon:SOP/font] [Font|/nodes/sop/font] tool on the __Create__ tab.
            
        # Move the cursor into the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

        # Click ((LMB)) to place the font object anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
            If you press ((Enter)) without clicking, Houdini places the font object at the origin.

        Press ((Ctrl + LMB)) on the [Icon:SOP/font] [Font|/nodes/sop/font] tool on the [shelf|/shelf/].
        
    NOTE: 
        Text can be moved once it is placed by either dragging it in the scene view or changing the values in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
    
    You can choose different font types from the Font drop-down menu, change text in the Text menu, and change the size of text in the Font Size menu on the operation controls toolbar.
    
    
    == Font Handles ==
    There are special handles available at the geometry level for the font object that allow you to stretch and squash it.
    
    # Move to the geometry level by double clicking ((LMB)) the font node in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network] or by clicking the __Jump to Operator__ button on the operation controls toolbar.
    
    # Drag the handles to squash or stretch the text.

        Drag the red handle.
            
    :task:Stretch or squash the font along the y-axis:
