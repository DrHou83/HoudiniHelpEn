"""Turns off the display flag for the selected object node."""

This tool allows you to hide entire objects at the object level. It is useful for clearing your scene so that it's easier to work with specific objects without accidentally altering others.

== Using Hide == 
                  
    # Select the object to hide in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
                  
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/hide]Hide tool on the __Modify__ tab.
