= RBD Objects =

"""Creates one or more rigid bodies from SOP geometry."""

The RBD Objects tool creates one or more rigid bodies inside the DOP simulation using the [RBD Packed Object DOP|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject].
If the SOP geometry has a `name` primitive attribute, the primitives will be separated into rigid bodies using the attribute values. Otherwise, the primitives will be separated into rigid bodies based on connectivity.

NOTE:
    [Include:rbdpackedobject_choose]
    If control over SDF settings and interaction with other solvers is required, or you wish to use the [Node:dop/rbdsolver] instead of the [Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver], use the [Shelf:rbdheroobject] or [Shelf:rbdfracturedobject] tool.

== Using RBD Objects ==

    # Select the geometry to convert to RBD objects.

    # If desired, pre-fracture the geometry. For example, using the [Shatter tool|Shelf:shatter].

    # Select the object and click the [Shelf:rbdobjects] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/rbdpackedobject][RBD Packed Object|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject] help.
