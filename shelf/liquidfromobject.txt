= Liquid from Object =

"""Creates a Liquid Object from SOP geometry."""

This tool only sets the initial conditions for the liquid from a specific object. It does not continuously generate liquid as a [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source][Source from volume|sourcefromvolume] does in a container. 

This tool can be used, for example, to simulate a drop of water dripping off an icicle. 

It can also be used to instantly fill an object with liquid. For example, you can create a tube inside a glass, apply this tool, and then hide the tube.

== Using Liquid from Object ==

# Create a [Icon:SHELF/box_fluid][Liquid Container|liquidbox] with a geometry object inside.

# Select the geometry object to convert to a liquid.

NOTE:
    The geometry object has to have volume to be a valid source for volume-based liquid. For example, this tool will not work on a [curve|Node:sop/curve].

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fluid][Liquid from Object|Node:dop/fluidobject] tool on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.

# Select the container to set the initial conditions and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

To change the display option of the simulation, alter the options on the __Guides__ tab of the Fluid Object. For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/fluidobject][Fluid Object|Node:dop/fluidobject] node help.
