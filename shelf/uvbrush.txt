"""Adjusts texture coordinates in the UV viewport by painting."""

Make sure the object has UVs and a [Icon:SHOP/vopmaterial][Material|/shade/] assigned to it. 

You also need to have a texture projected onto a [model|/model/] in order to use the UV Brush tool. This tool lets you move the UV texture coordinates by [brushing|/basics/brush]. This is useful when you want to minor edits.
