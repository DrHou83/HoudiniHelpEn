This tool creates hair guides as you draw curves in the viewport. It is like the [Icon:FUR/add_fur][Add Fur|/shelf/groom_addfur] tool; however, instead of selecting an object and adding fur all over it, you are able to interactively draw where you want the hair in the viewport. No guides are generated procedurally. Guides can be drawn in the screen plane or along the skin geometry. This tool is typically used for the basic setup of long hair.

Once the curves are drawn, you may want to add more style to the general direction of hairs. This can be easily done using the [Icon:FUR/screen_brush][Comb on Screen|/shelf/screenbrush] or [Icon:FUR/surface_brush][Surface Brush|/shelf/surfacebrush] shelf tools.


== Using Draw Hair == (includeme)

:task:Draw a guide away from the skin:
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/drawhair][Draw Hair|Node:sop/guidedraw] tool on the __Grooming__ tab.

    # Select the geometry to draw hair on and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Rotate the camera to look at the skin where you want to draw the hair. Hair will be drawn on a plane that is parallel to the camera.

    # Click ((LMB)) the surface of the object in the spot you want to draw the hair, and drag your cursor to draw the hair from the root to tip.

:task:Draw short fur onto Skin:

    # Click the [Icon:SOP/drawhair][Draw Hair|Node:sop/guidedraw] tool on the __Grooming__ tab.

    # Select the geometry to draw hair on and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Change the __Draw On__ parameter to __Skin__. This will project the hairs onto the surface of the skin.
    
    # Turn on the __Limit Curve Length__ checkbox and set the length of the fur you want to draw. You can also turn on __Create Roots Along Stroke__, if you want hairs to be created as you drag.

    # Click ((LMB)) the surface of the object in the spot you want to draw the hair, and drag your cursor to draw the hair from the root to tip.

TIP:
    Scrolling the mouse wheel or holding ((Shift)) while dragging ((LMB)) will let you resize your brush.
        
NOTE:
    Hair length can easily be adjusted afterward using the [Length Adjust|/shelf/lengthadjust] tool.
    
For specific parameter information, see the [Draw Hair Guides|Node:sop/guidedraw] help.
                
== Tips ==

Turn off __Display__ > __Object Visibility__ > __All Other Object Types__ when grooming, so that you don't see another version of the guides when animating. This is especially important when adding dynamics to fur, since they will recook as you groom. You may want to do this even if you are not animating. Visually it won't make a difference, but it will be slower since the fur is being drawn twice.
        
:task:Control how dense the fur is drawn:
    Adjust the __Guide Spacing__ parameter on the __Root Creation__ tab.
        
:task:Control specifically where hair is drawn:
    Create a group for the geometry you want to draw hairs on, and reference it in the __Skin Group__ parameter. 
        
    For example, it is useful to create a `scalp` group for human characters, to avoid accidentally drawing hair on the forehead and neck.
        
:task:Push hair away from the skin:
    Increase the __Skin Normal Force__ on the __Guide Advection__ tab. This makes the hair stand up off the skin, instead of laying flat.
        
:task:Hide guides and see the roots as points on the skin:
    Turn on the __Display Roots Points Only__ on the __Root Creation__ tab.
