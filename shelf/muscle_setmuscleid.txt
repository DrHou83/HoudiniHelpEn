= Set Muscle ID =

"""Sets the Muscle ID for selected muscles."""

This tool will change the Muscle ID parameter of selected muscle objects.

The Muscle ID is used as a grouping mechanism when using the [Muscle Displace|/shelf/muscle_displace] workflow.  The Muscle ID parameter simply sets a `muscle_id` point attribute on associated muscles.  All muscles sharing a common value for the `muscle_id` attribute will be treated as the same deformer geometry when displacing skin using a [Muscle Deform SOP|Node:sop/muscledeform].  The deforming influence of the grouped muscle objects is combined as though they were a single muscle.

See the [Icon:SOP/inflate][Muscle Deform SOP|Node:sop/muscledeform] for more information.


== Setting Muscle ID == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:MISC/rename] __Set Muscle ID__ tool on the __Muscles__ shelf tab.
    
    # Select the muscles, muscle rigs, and franken muscles that you wish to assign a new Muscle ID and press ((Enter)).

    # A dialog box will appear.  Enter the new value for the __Muscle_ID__ and press the((Accept)) button.  
	

The ID you enter can be either a string or a numerical value.  For example, you can use the string `L_upper_arm` to represent the muscles `L_bicep`, `L_triceps`, `L_bracialis`. 


TIP:
	Using the expression variable `$OS` will make all selected muscle ID's unique.  Essentially this does the opposite of setting a common ID for a group of muscles.  `$OS` evaluates to the object node name of each selected item.
