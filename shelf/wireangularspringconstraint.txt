= Wire Angular Spring Constraint =

"""Constrains the rotation of a point on a wire object so it attempts to rotate naturally, but bounces back to its original rotation."""

You need to create a [Icon:DOP/wireobject][Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject] before you can use this tool. For example, this is can be used for an arrow hitting the ground.

    # Click the [Icon:DOP/wireangularspringconstraint][Wire Angular Spring Constraint|Node:dop/wireangularspringconstraint] tool on the __Wires__ tab.
        
    # Select the dynamic object or points to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        NOTE:
            If you select the whole object, the constraint will be placed at the root of the object.

    In this example, the yellow line illustrates the angular spring constraint which is attempting to return to the object's original rotation.
