= Wire Spring Constraint =

"""Provides controls for setting up basic spring constraints for wire objects."""

This tool constrains points on the wire object to a “goal” location derived
from another simulation object or from a position in world space. You need to
create a [Icon:DOP/wireobject][Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject] before invoking this tool. You can use this tool, for
example, to simulate a bungee cord.

== Using Wire Spring Constraint == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/wirespringconstraint]Wire Spring Constraint tool on the __Wires__ tab.
        
    # Select the [Icon:DOP/wireobject][Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject] or points on the wire object to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        NOTE:
            If you select the whole object, the constraint will be placed at the root of the object.
