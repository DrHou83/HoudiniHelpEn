= Combine =

"""Merges the geometry of multiple objects into the last selected one."""

This can be used, for example, to merge parts of a car model into one object. 

NOTE:
    This is a modeling tool and will not work with animation. 

If you want to leave the original objects alone and create object merges, select the objects and choose use the [Icon:SHELF/extract_object][Extract|/shelf/extract] tool on the __Modify__ tab of the shelf.

== Using Combine ==
        
    # Select the objects you wish to merge. Hold ((Shift)) to select multiple objects.

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/combine_objects] Combine tool on the __Modify__ tab.
