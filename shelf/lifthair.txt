= Lift Hair =

"""Lets you interactively push hair away from the surface."""

This tool allows you to interactively push hair away from the surface. This tool takes any hair that is inside the brush radius and lets you lift it from the surface. It is useful for creating patches of rough fur, for example when modeling animal fur. It allows you to break up perfectly smooth fur easily, without having to comb it . Lift is also good for imparting more realism to hair and for preventing skin penetration in the root area.
