"""Applies a gravity-like force to objects."""

This tool is used to apply gravity to objects, and make them fall naturally.

== Using Gravity Force == (includeme)
    
    # Select the dynamic object to apply gravity force.
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/gravity][Gravity Force|Node:dop/gravity] tool on the __Drive Simulation__ tab.

    NOTE:
        Gravity force is simply a predefined [Icon:POP/force][Force|Node:pop/force] node whose force and direction can be altered in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
