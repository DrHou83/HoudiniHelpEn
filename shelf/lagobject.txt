"""Makes one object lag behind another object."""

This tool sets up a [parameter effect|/network/motioneffects] that makes one object lag behind another, optionally slowing down motion and adding overshoot, like a heavy object being towed.

# [Select|/basics/select] the object that will lag.
              
# Click the [Icon:CHOP/lag] [Lag|Node:chop/lag] tool on the __Animation__ tab of the shelf.

# Select the object whose animation the "lagging" object will follow and press ((Enter)).
