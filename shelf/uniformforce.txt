= Uniform Force =

"""Applies a uniform force and torque to objects."""

This tool can be used, for example, to simulate a car driving. You can apply uniform force and [torque|torque] to its wheels to make it move.

== Using Uniform Force == (includeme)
    
    # Select the dynamic object to apply uniform force to.
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/uniformforce][Uniform Force|Node:dop/uniformforce] tool on the __Drive Simulation__ tab.

    NOTE:
        Uniform force is simply a predefined force node whose force and direction can be altered in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
        
For specific parameter node help see the [Icon:DOP/uniformforce][Uniform Force|Node:dop/uniformforce] help.
