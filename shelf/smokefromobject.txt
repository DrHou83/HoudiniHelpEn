= Smoke from Object =

"""Creates a Smoke Object from SOP Geometry."""

This tool sets the initial smoke conditions in the box. It does not continuously generate smoke as a [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source][Source from volume|sourcefromvolume] does in a container. This tool can be used, for example, to generate a puff of smoke or dust from a collision.



== Using Smoke from Object ==

# Create a [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox] with a geometry object inside.

# Select the geometry object to convert to a smoke object.

    NOTE:
        The geometry object has to have volume to be a valid source for volume-based smoke. For example, this tool will not work on a [curve|Node:sop/curve].

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_smoke][Smoke from Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] tool on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.

# Select the container to set the initial conditions and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

:task:Change the display option of the simulation:
    Alter the options on the __Guides__ tab of the Smoke Object. For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/smokeobject][Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] node help.
        
:task:Change the buoyancy rate:
    Alter the default __Buoyancy Lift__ on the __Forces__ tab of the [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver]. This parameter controls the rise and fall of smoke.
    
:task:Change the cooling rate:
    Alter the default __Cooling Rate__ on the __Forces__ tab of the [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver]. This parameter controls how fast the temperature field trends to zero.
        
:task:Make the smoke cold (and fall):
    On the [Volume Ramp|Node:sop/volumeramp] node in your object, select the right-side handle of the __Scalar Ramp__ scale and change the __Value__ to -1.
        
    NOTE:
        The temperature does not work on any real world scale such as degrees or kelvins. Houdini works on the premise that 0 is neutral, a positive value is warm, and a negative value is cold.
