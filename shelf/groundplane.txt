= Ground Plane =

"""Creates an infinite ground plane suitable for RBD, cloth, or wire simulations."""

This is useful to simulate ground as it covers infinite space. The surface created by a [terrain object|terrainobject], on the other hand, is only as big as the original geometry.

== Using Ground Planes == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/groundplane][Ground Plane|Node:dop/groundplane] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

    NOTE: 
        You can [transform|/basics/handles], [rotate|/basics/handles], [scale|/basics/handles], and [keyframe|/anim/basics] the ground plane at various frames.
    
== Switching to the dynamics level ==
    
# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics][Dynamics Select Mode|/basics/select] button on the selector and handle controls toolbar.
    
# Click ((LMB)) the ground plane in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
