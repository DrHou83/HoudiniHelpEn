= RBD Hinge Constraint =

"""Constrains an object to a point in space using a hinge-like connection."""

This tool is useful for simulating anything that needs a hinge-like constraint, such as a swing. 

You need to create an [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD object|/shelf/rbdobject] to apply this constraint to before you can use this tool.

NOTE:
        This constraint will not work with packed primitives. However, you can achieve the equivalent using a [constraint network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork], such as the one created by the [Icon:PARTS/glue][Glue Adjacent|/shelf/gluenetwork] shelf tool.

== Using RBD Hinge Constraints == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/rbdhingeconstraint][RBD Hinge Constraint|Node:dop/rbdhingeconstraint] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.
    
    # Select the object to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    # Select the position for the hinge constraint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
        NOTE:
            You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the constraint from the construction plane.
    
    # Set the direction for the hinge using the handle in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] or by setting the __Constraint Direction__ parameters in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/rbdhingeconstraint][RBD Hinge Constraint|Node:dop/rbdhingeconstraint] dynamics node help.
  
== Moving an RBD Hinge Constraint ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the constrained object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

# Click ((RMB)) the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button and turn on the __Dynamics Modifiers__ checkbox.

# Click ((LMB)) the constraint you want to edit and press ((Enter)) to display the [transformation handles|/basics/handles_xform].

  
== Switching to the dynamics level ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the constrained object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
