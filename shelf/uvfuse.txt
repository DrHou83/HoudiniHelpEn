= UV Fuse =

"""Merges UVs."""

Make sure the object has UVs and a [Icon:SHOP/vopmaterial][Material|/shade/materials] assigned to it. 

You also need to have a texture projected onto a [model|/model] in order to use the UV Fuse tool. This tool is useful for merging UVs once they are unwrapped.

== Using UV Fuse == (includeme)
    
    # Select the UVs you want to fuse.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/uvfuse][UV Fuse|Node:sop/uvfuse] tool on the __Texture__ tab.

    NOTE:
        This tool is often used with [Icon:SOP/uvunwrap][UV Unwrap|Node:sop/uvunwrap].
