"""Adds an environment light using caustic photon maps, causing other lights in the scene to cast caustic reflections/refractions."""

This tool creates an [Environment light|Node:obj/envlight] and sets the
__Light type__ parameter to "Caustic photon map".

NOTE:
        This tool is not actually a light. It is a caustic photon map generator that requires one or more lights in the scene to see results.
