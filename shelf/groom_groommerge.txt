= Merge Groom Objects =

"""Combines the guides and skin of multiple groom objects."""

It is often useful to set up a groom using separate [Guide
Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] objects, but you usually don't want to
[animate|Shelf:groom_animateguides] or [simulate|Shelf:groom_simguides] them
individually. This tool takes individual grooms from different parts of the character, and merges them together. Once they are merged, you can continue adding nodes to the single stream and not be concerned with the individual grooms anymore.

[Guide Deform|Node:obj/guidedeform], [Guide Simulate|Node:obj/guidesim], and [Hair Generate|Node:/obj/hairgen] can operate on the output of this node, so they only have to be set up once.

This is useful for working separately on different parts of a character. Often different parts have fur of varying directions, lengths, and densities. This tool allows you to merge the separate parts together seamlessly.

For more information, see the [Fur Workflow|/fur/workflow] help.

== Using Merge Groom Objects == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/groommerge]__Groom Merge__ tool on the __Hair Utils__ tab.

    # Select the groom objects to merge and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    For specific parameter help see the [Groom Merge|Node:obj/groommerge] node help.

NOTE:
    [Guide Groom|Node:/obj/guidegroom] can also take any groom node, including [Groom Merge|Node:obj/groommerge] as input.
    
TIP:
    You can add multiple [Hair Generate|Node:/obj/hairgen] or [Guide Deform|Node:obj/guidedeform] nodes after the merge to continue to work on the individual parts.
