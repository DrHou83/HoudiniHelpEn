== Using Mirror Muscle Mask ==
    
    # Click the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/mirrorcapture][Mirror Muscle Mask|Node:sop/capturemirror] tool on the __Muscles__ tab.
    
    # Select the destination points to mirror the weights to and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. 
        NOTE:
            You must include the symmetry points as well. If you've completely painted just one side of muscles, it's easiest to just select all points.
    
    # Select the source muscles to mirror from and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    # Select the destination muscles and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

== Tips ==

- If you do not get the desired results, you can specify the exact muscles to mirror to by clicking the __Spreadsheet__ button on the operation controls toolbar and choosing the corresponding muscles in the drop-down menu.

- You can choose the exact muscles to mirror to by changing the __From__ and __To__ values in the parameter editor. The first item in the From list corresponds with the first item in the To list and so on.

NOTE:
    A [Capture Mirror SOP|Node:sop/capturemirror] will be created in the object where you are mirroring muscle mask weights. The SOP will be created as the input to the [Muscle Deform SOP|Node:sop/muscledeform] if there is one, or as the end of the SOP chain if there is no such node. You will be presented with handles that allow you to define the plane through which the capture weights are mirrored.
