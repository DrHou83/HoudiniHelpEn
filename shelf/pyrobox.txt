"""Creates a container for pyro effects."""

This tool may be useful if you are creating your own pyro effect network from scratch. You do not need to use this tool if you use the tools on the [Pyro FX shelf tab|pyro] to create pre-made pyro effects.

See [how to create pyro effects|/pyro/pyro].

== Using Pyro Container ==

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/box_fire] Pyro Container button on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.
    
    # Place the container anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
    
    TIP:
        You can ((Ctrl))-click the icon on the shelf to automatically place a new pyro container at the origin.
