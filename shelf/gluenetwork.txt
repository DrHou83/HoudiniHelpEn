"""Creates glue constraints between adjacent RBD objects."""

This tool is similar to [RBD Glue Object|Node:dop/rbdglueobject], however instead of gluing all pieces to each other, only pieces that are adjacent are constrained. The Glue Adjacent tool creates four nodes: a [Constraint Network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork] and a [Glue Constraint Relationship|Node:dop/glueconrel] in the DOP network, and a [Connect Adjacent Pieces SOP|Node:sop/connectadjacentpieces] and an [Attrib Wrangle SOP|Node:sop/attribwrangle] in a new geometry object.

NOTE:
    This tool only works with the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/rigidbodysolver]. You can change the type of solver in the __Solver Engine__ dropdown menu on the [Rigid Body Solver|Node:dop/rigidbodysolver].
    
TIP:
        To remove the name prefix, you can change the __Object Names__ parameter on the [DOP Import SOP|Node:sop/dopimport] from __Use Full Path to Object__ to __Use DOP Object Name__.

== How to ==

# Select any simulated objects you want to glue together.

# In the __Rigid Bodies__ shelf tab, click [Icon:PARTS/glue] __Glue Adjacent__.

You will see a little black line appear between the objects once they are glued.

The tool will create glue constraints between selected objects that are close together. This lets you, for example, select a whole stack of boxes and use __Glue Adjacent__ to glue each box to its neighbors. If the objects you are trying to glue are too far apart, you can increase the __Search Radius__ on the [Connect Adjacent Pieces SOP|Node:sop/connectadjacentpieces].
