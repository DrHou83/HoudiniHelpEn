= Parent Constraint =

"""Changes the parent of a constraint from a point in space to a goal object."""

This tool is useful for [constraining|Node:dop/conrelationship] a constrained object to another. For example, you can constrain two things rolling down a hill together.

You need to create a constrained [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD object|/shelf/rbdobject] before you can use this tool.

NOTE:
        This constraint will not work with packed primitives. However, you can achieve the equivalent using a [constraint network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork], such as the one created by the [Icon:PARTS/glue][Glue Adjacent|/shelf/gluenetwork] shelf tool.

== Using Parent Constraints ==

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/parent_constraint]Parent Constraint tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ or __Animation__ tab.

# Select the constraint to change parent and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

# Select the new goal object and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

== Moving a Parent Constraint ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the constrained object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

# Click ((RMB)) the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button and turn on the __Dynamics Modifiers__ checkbox.

# Click ((LMB)) the constraint you want to edit and press ((Enter)) to display the transformation handles.

   
== Switching to the dynamics level ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the constrained object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
