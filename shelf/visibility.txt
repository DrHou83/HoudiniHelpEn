= Visibility =

"""Reverses or cycles the vertex order of faces."""

This tool is useful for making primitives invisible so you can edit parts of your [model|/model/] without accidentally modifying other nearby parts.

== Using Visibility == (includeme)

    # Select the primitives to hide or expose.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/visibility][Visibility|Node:sop/visibility] tool on the __Model__ tab.

        You can edit the visibility settings in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

    This tool does not delete the selected area, it merely hides it. This is useful because the remaining points do not change as they would if the area was deleted and it does not affect rendering. 
    
    You can get primitives to reappear by choosing Expose Primitives in the __Action__ drop-down menu in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] or by deleting or bypassing the [visibility|Node:sop/visibility] node in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network].

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/visibility][Visibility|Node:sop/visibility] node help.
