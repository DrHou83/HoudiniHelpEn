"""Adds an environment light that only shines through geometry you select. This is much more efficient for enclosed environments where the environment light can only enter through a few portals (windows, doors)."""

This tool creates an [Environment light|Node:obj/envlight] and sets the __Portal geometry__ parameter to the geometry object you select.

A regular environment light casts light on the scene from all directions. For an enclosed scene such as a room, where the "environment" light is outside and only enters through a few windows and doors, most of the light will simply hit the walls. The __Portal geometry__ parameter specifies geometry (e.g. windows and doors) through which the light can enter. The environment light will only calculate light traveling through the portals, greatly improving efficiency.

== Making an environment light that shines through portals ==

* Select the object(s) you want to act as portals for the environment light, then click the [Icon:OBJ/light_portal] Portal Light tool on the shelf.

    or
    
* With nothing selected, click the [Icon:OBJ/light_portal] Portal Light tool on the shelf, then select the object(s) you want to act as portals for the environment light and press ((Enter)).
