"""Creates a burning object with smoke and an auto-resizeable flamefront container from SOP geometry."""

This tool only combusts on the second frame and sets the initial fuel distribution from a single object. It does not continuously add fuel to burn as a [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source][Source from volume|sourcefromvolume] does in a container; however, once the fuel burns it will produce smoke and soot.

This tool can be used, for example, to simulate a bomb exploding.

== Using Burn from Object ==

# Select the geometry object to convert to a fire object.

NOTE:
    The geometry object has to have volume to be a valid source for volume-based fire. For example, this tool will not work on a [curve|Node:sop/curve].

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fire][Burn from Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] tool on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.

# If you have a flamefront container, select it to set the initial conditions and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. 

If you do not have a container, press ((Enter)) and the tool will create one for you. The smaller yellow one is the flamefront container, and the larger white one is the smoke container.

You will see a blue iso surface around the object when you hit play, which is the flame front of the fire. The flame front is always contracting inwards at the current flame speed, and leaves behind burnt voxels (yellow).

:task:Change the display option of the simulation:
    Alter the options on the __Guides__ tab of the [Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject]. For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/smokeobject][Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] node help.
        
:task:Change the buoyancy rate:
    Alter the default __Buoyancy Lift__ on the __Forces__ tab of the [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver]. This parameter controls the rise and fall of smoke.
    
:task:Change the cooling rate:
    Alter the default __Cooling Rate__ on the __Forces__ tab of the [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver]. This parameter controls how fast the temperature field trends to zero.
    
:task:Alter the temperature at which the object ignites, burns, and creates soot:
    Alter the default settings on the __Reactions__ tab of the [Smoke Solver|Node:dop/smokesolver].
