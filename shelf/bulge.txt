    # Click the [Icon:SOP/bulge][Bulge|Node:sop/bulge] tool on the __Deform__ tab.
    
    # Select the geometry to deform and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        NOTE:
            The bulge will be more visible if your geometry has a lot of detail.
    
    # Select the [Icon:SOP/metaball][magnet metaballs|/shelf/metaball] and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    # Increase or decrease the __Magnitude__ in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] to create a bulge.
    
    # Click ((LMB)) the metaball transform object node in the network editor to move the [metaballs|/shelf/metaball] under the surface of the geometry.
    
    NOTE:
        If the [Icon:SOP/metaball][metaballs|/shelf/metaball] are peaking through the surface of the geometry, adjust them so they merely bulge slightly against the surface.
