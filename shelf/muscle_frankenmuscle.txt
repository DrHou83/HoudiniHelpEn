= Franken Muscle =

"""Creates a hybrid muscle made up of any number of geometry objects and any number of muscle rigs and pins."""

This tool creates a muscle made up of any number of geometry objects and any number of muscle rigs and pins. The [Franken Muscle object|Node:obj/frankenmuscle] will function just like a regular muscle used in either FEM or non-FEM workflows. 

This is useful because not all muscles are sausage shaped. Being able to merge one or more muscle rigs into a single muscle gives you the ability to have multiple attach points for more complex muscle shapes, such as pectoral muscles or abdominal muscles.

The [Franken Muscle|Node:obj/frankenmuscle] asset will be created by prompting you for the items to merge. Once it's created, the geometry objects will have their visibility toggled off, and the franken muscle geometry will be displayed instead. This new geometry is formed by volume merging the input geometries and tetrahedralizing the result.  If the franken muscle is to be used in a non-FEM workflow, (using the [Muscle Displace tool|/shelf/muscle_displace], then the tetrahedrons are surfaced for that application.

NOTE:
    The collected components that comprise a franken muscle are very much "live" and continue to be procedurally tied to your resulting muscle.  Any change to the input geometry will cause the franken muscle to be reconstructed.

	The original muscle rigs continue to be used to control the placement and shape of the franken muscle. It is imperative that the __Capture Pose__ for those muscle rigs be in the proper alignment with your muscle geometry.  This will ensure that your muscle rigs properly capture and deform your muscle geometry.
	

== Creating Franken Muscles == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:OBJ/frankenmuscle][Franken Muscle|Node:obj/frankenmuscle] tool on the __Muscles__ shelf tab.
    
    # Select the geometry objects to be merged into your franken muscle and press ((Enter)).  Any number of objects can be used.  You may also select other muscles to have their geometry included.

    # Select the muscle rigs to be used by your franken muscle and press ((Enter)). These rigs will remain active and will be used as the animation controls for the resulting franken muscle.
    
    TIP:
        You can merge multiple existing muscles into one franken muscle by selecting other pre-existing muscles when prompted for the geometry. Once a franken muscle has been created, you can re-specify the geometry or rig components by using the __Add or Remove Geometry__ button or the __Add or Remove Rigs__ button.
