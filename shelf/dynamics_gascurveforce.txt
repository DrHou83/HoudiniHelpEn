= Curve Force =

"""Creates forces generated from a curve."""

This tool uses the [Gas Curve Force|Node:dop/gascurveforce] node to apply a force to volume-based fluids to steer them along, toward, or around a curve.

== Using Curve Force == (includeme)

        # Create a curve using the [Icon:SOP/drawcurve][Draw Curve|/shelf/drawcurve] shelf tool.
        
        # Create a volume-based fluid (either Smoke or Pyro) along, or at the start of, the curve using their respective shelf tools.
        
        # Click the [Icon:DOP/vortexforce][Curve Force|Node:dop/gascurveforce] tool on the __Container Tools__ tab.
        
        # Select the curve you want to affect your fluid and press ((Enter)).

        # Select the fluid object you want the curve to affect and press ((Enter)).
