= Volume Collider =

"""Create a Static Object from SOP Geometry pre-configured for interaction with cloth."""

This tool is used for a static object that influences a [Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject]. It is similar to the [Surface Collider|/shelf/clothbodycollider], the main difference being that the Deforming Collider interacts with polygons and the Volume Collider interacts with volumes. 

You should use a [Surface Collider|/shelf/clothbodycollider] if your static object is moving around and colliding with cloth, such as for the body of a character interacting with clothing. You should use a Volume Collider if your object is not deforming, for example for a terrain that a cloth object is interacting with.
        
== Using Volume Collider ==

    # Select the geometry to convert to a static object.
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/surfacecollisionparms][Volume Collider|Node:dop/staticobject] tool on the __Cloth__ or __Solid__ tab.

    NOTE: 
        You can [transform, rotate, scale|/basics/handles], and [keyframe|/anim/basics] the static object at various frames.

The following example is an organic tissue object falling down a staircase.

TIP:
        When using volume-based collisions, only the cloth points collide with the volume. If you want more accurate collisions, disable __Volume Based Collisions__ on the [Static Object|Node:dop/staticobject].
