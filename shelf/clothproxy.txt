"""Assigns geometry for simulation and transfers over the motion from the simulation geometry to the rendering geometry."""

This tool lets you assign a different geometry for simulation and transfer over the motion from the simulation geometry to the rendering geometry using the [Cloth Capture|Node:SOP/clothcapture] and [Cloth Deform|Node:sop/clothdeform] SOPs.

This is useful when you are animating a model and you can't easily subdivide the simulation geometry. Often, the geometry thatâ€™s used for rendering the cloth is not very suitable for simulation purposes. The number of polygons in the rendering geometry may be too high, and the shape of the polygons on the mesh may be ill-suited for nice looking simulations. 

== Using Cloth Proxy ==

# Click the [Icon:SOP/clothcapture]Cloth Proxy tool on the __Cloth__ tab.

# Select a the geometry object to deform with simulated cloth and press ((Enter)) to complete your selection.

# Select the simulated cloth object to use as a deformer and press ((Enter)) to complete your selection.
