"""Continuously generates smoke, fire, or liquid from the points of an object in a container."""

This tool continuously generates fluid from the points of an object, and is similar to [Source from Volume|sourcefromvolume] and [Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface]. All three create a continuous flow of fluid; however, this tool only generates fluid from the points of an object, as opposed to the entire volume or entire surface of an object.

Keep in mind, this tool generates volume based fluid, as opposed to the [Icon:DOP/particlefluidemitter][Emit Particle Fluid|emitparticlefluid] tool which generates particle based fluid.

TIP:
    If you are sourcing from an object that deforms, or collides with a deforming object, the solvers ([smoke solver|Node:dop/smokesolver], [fluid solver|Node:dop/fluidsolver], and [pyro solver|Node:dop/pyrosolver]) do not pay attention to the per-point deformation. You need to set the __Velocity Type__ to __Point Velocity__, which is a parameter on the __Fields > Sources__ subtab of the solvers.

== Using Source from Points ==

    # Create an open geometry object within a container.
        For more information on containers see: [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox], [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Flamefront Container|firebox], and [Icon:SHELF/box_fluid][Liquid Container|liquidbox].

    # Select the geometry object to generate the source.

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source]__Source from Points__ tool on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.

    # Select the container to put the source into and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

NOTE:
    To turn off the continuous flow of fluid, set the __Activation__ to `0` on the [Source Relationship|Node:dop/sourcerel] node in the [AutoDopNetwork|Node:obj/dopnet]. You can [keyframe|/anim/basics] this parameter to control when the fluid is emitted.

This tool is different than using [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_smoke][Smoke from Object|smokefromobject], [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fire][Burn from Object|burstintoflame], and [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fluid][Liquid from Object|liquidfromobject] because it emits fluid continuously. It also useful as it allows you to create and simulate multiple objects in the container, whereas the other tools set the initial conditions from one object.

If the object is only partially in the container, only the portion of the object that is in the container's boundaries will be simulated.

You can control the behavior of the fluid by editing the parameters of the fluid object. For more information on editing specific parameters, see the [Icon:DOP/smokeobject][Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] and [Icon:DOP/fluidobject][Fluid Object|Node:dop/fluidobject] node help.
    NOTE:
        Fire and smoke are both created by the [Icon:DOP/smokeobject][Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] node. They simply have different default parameters.
