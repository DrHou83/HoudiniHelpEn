= Collision Detect =

"""Detects and reacts to collisions."""

This tool uses the [POP Collision Detect|Node:dop/popcollisiondetect] node to detect and react to collisions. You can use this tool to get particles to move, die, stick or slide on an object once they hit.

TIP:
        For simple RBD collisions, you can use the controls on the __Collision Behavior__ tab of the [POP Solver|Node:dop/popsolver].

Bouncing is handled using [Static Objects|Node:dop/staticobject] or [RBD Objects|Node:dop/rbdobject].

== Using Collision Detect == (includeme)

    # Create a particle system along the curve using the [Icon:POP/location][Location|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] or [Icon:POP/source][Source|/shelf/dynamics_popsource] shelf tools.
    
    # Create an object for the [particle system|/dopparticles] to collide with.

    # Click the [Icon:POP/collision][Collision Detect|Node:dop/popcollisiondetect] tool on the __Particles__ tab.
    
    # Select the object for collision detection and press ((Enter)).
 
        For specific parameter help, see the [Icon:POP/collision][Collision Detect|Node:dop/popcollisiondetect] node help. You can choose what happens to the particles once they hit using the options on the __Behavior__ tab.
        
        NOTE:
                Turn on __Move to Hit__ if you want to trigger an effect from a particle's collision. For example, if you want to birth more particles, you want the particle at the hit location, not where it ended up at the end of the frame. This will move the particle back to it's hit location.

        In the following example, particles that hit the box are sticking to it and are colored red.
