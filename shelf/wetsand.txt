= Wet Sand =

"""Creates a grain object from a piece of geometry, with a clumpy wet look."""

This tool lets you pick a piece of geometry and fill it with closely packed grains that clump together like wet sand. It essentially creates the same network as [Dry Sand|/shelf/drysand] but enables clumping weights and sets an attribute called `wetness`. This attribute is useful for creating partially wet and partially dry sand, such as a sandbox or a beach.



== Using Wet Sand == (includeme)

    # Select the geometry object to convert to wet sand.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/wet_sand][Wet Sand|Node:dop/popgrains] tool on the __Grains__ tab.

For specific parameter information, see the [POP Grains|Node:dop/popgrains] help.
    
NOTE:
        Scaling is an issue for sand because the number of grains are based on how many particles are around it. Changing resolutions may change results.
