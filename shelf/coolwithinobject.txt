= Cool Within Object =

"""Turns an object into a source of cooling when particles pass through."""

This tool will take an object and turn it into a source of cooling when particles pass through. You would typically use this tool if you want to cool a fluid in your scene that has been set up with another one of the tools on the Viscous Fluid shelf. For example, if you are simulating a river of lava, you can create cool zones causing the fluid to harden when it reaches certain areas to control the flow of the river.

== Using Cool Within Object ==

# Select the object to be the cooling source.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/cool_within_object]__Cool Within Object__ tool on the Viscous Fluids tab. 

# Select the hot fluid to be cooled, and press ((Enter)).

    For specific parameter information, see the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject] and [POP Attribute from Volume|Node:dop/popattribfromvolume] help pages.
