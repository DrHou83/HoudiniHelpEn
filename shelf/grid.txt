    NOTE: 
        The grid can be moved once it is placed by either dragging it in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] or changing the values in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
       
        
    == Grid Handles ==
    There are special handles available at the geometry level for the grid object that allow you to scale it.
    
    # Move to the geometry level by double clicking ((LMB)) the grid node in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network] or by clicking the __Jump to Operator__ button on the operation controls toolbar.
    
    # Drag the handles to enlarge or shrink the grid.
