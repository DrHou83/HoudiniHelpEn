"""Allows you to build an IK bone rig (with or without a Twist Affector) from existing objects in the scene."""

The IK from Objects tool allows you to build an IK bone rig (with or without a Twist Affector) from existing objects in the scene. This is useful if you have a prop or series of objects in the scene that you would like to create a simple relationship for quickly.

NOTE:
    You must have at least 2 objects in the scene to use this tool.

    # Click the [Icon:OBJ/autorig_blank] IK from Objects tool on the __Rigging__ tab.

    # Choose the type of IK solver to create: __Basic IK__ or __IK with Twist Affector__.
    
        Basic IK:
            Uses an IK solver. The solution is uniquely defined by the end affector position. Constraint parameters are ignored. 
        IK with Twist:
            Uses a null object for the Inverse Kinematics solver twist parameter. This parameter specifies an additional twist angle to be applied to the solution bone angles.
    
    # Select a naming prefix for the nodes to be created.
    
    # Select a Parent for the bone chain, if any, and press ((Enter)) to complete.
    
    # Select the sequence of objects to use as bone positions, press ((Enter)) to complete. You can also click ((RMB)) in the viewport and choose __Accept Selection__.
    
A complete bone rig will be created in the network editor, and placed in a Netbox. Select the green `ikfromobjects_interface` node to see the [rig parameters|Node:obj/autobonechaininterface].
