= RBD Hero Object =

"""Creates an RBD Object from SOP Geometry."""

This tool creates an rigid body dynamic object for simulation. It creates a new dynamic object and attaches the subdata required for it to be a properly conforming RBD Object.

Unlike [RBD Objects|/shelf/rbdobjects], this tool does not use packed primitives and works with the [RBD solver|Node:dop/rbdsolver] as well as the [Bullet Solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver]. It also has controls over its SDF representation for interaction with fluids. You would typically want to use this for interaction with fluid, cloth, having particles stick to it, etc. 

NOTE:
    [RBD Objects|/shelf/rbdobjects] is the default you should use if you just want to create a bunch of RBD objects from geometry, which could be prefractured or groups of connected primitives. It will put down an [RBD Packed Object DOP|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject], which will be significantly faster and use less memory for large simulations.


== Using RBD Hero Object == (includeme)
    
    # Select the geometry to convert to an RBD Object.
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD Hero Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

    NOTE:
        Once you convert geometry to an RBD Hero Object you can only [transform, rotate, and scale|/basics/handles_xform] it when it is on the first frame.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] dynamics node help.
    
== Switching to the dynamics level ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the RBD object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
