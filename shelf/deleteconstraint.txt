= Delete Constraint =

"""Deletes an existing soft body constraint."""

You need to create a soft body object (wire or cloth) and a [constraint|Node:dop/conrelationship] before you can use this tool. This is a very simple tool that deletes only constraints.

== Using Delete Constraint ==

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/detach_constraint]Delete Constraint tool on the __Wires__ or __Cloth__ tab.

    # Select the constraints to delete. Press ((Enter)) to accept selection and delete the selected constraints.
