= Cone Twist Constraint =

"""Constrains an object to remain a certain distance from the constraint, and limits the object's rotation."""

This tool can be used to create joints with a limited range of motion, such as the shoulder joint on a ragdoll.

You need to create an [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD object|/shelf/rbdobject] to apply this constraint to before you can use this tool.

This constraint type is currently only supported by the Bullet solver.

NOTE:
        This constraint will not work with packed primitives. However, you can achieve the equivalent using a [constraint network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork], such as the one created by the [Icon:PARTS/glue][Glue Adjacent|/shelf/gluenetwork] shelf tool.

== Using RBD Cone Twist Constraints == (includeme)

    # Click the [RBD Cone Twist Constraint|Node:dop/rbdconetwistconstraint] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

    # Select the object to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Select the position for the cone twist constraint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

	NOTE:
	    You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the constraint from the construction plane.

    # Set the __Goal Twist Axis__ and  __Goal Up Axis__ on the __Cone Twist__ tab in the parameter editor. To restrict the range of motion, modify __Max Up Rotation__, __Max Out Rotation__ and __Max Twist__.

For specific parameter help see the [RBD Cone Twist Constraint|Node:dop/rbdconetwistconstraint] dynamics node help.

== Moving an RBD Cone Twist Constraint ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the constrained object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

# Click ((RMB)) the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button and turn on the __Dynamics Modifiers__ checkbox.

# Click ((LMB)) the constraint you want to edit and press ((Enter)) to display the [transformation handles|/basics/handles].



== Switching to the dynamics level ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the constrained object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
