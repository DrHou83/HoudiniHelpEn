= Convert =

"""Converts geometry from one geometry type to another."""

This tool is useful when you want to convert the geometry type of an object that you have already spent time modifying. This allows you to change the geometry type without going back to the original node. For example, a polygonal [curve|/shelf/curve] to a NURBS curve, or a primitive object to a polygonal object.

== Using Convert == (includeme)

    # Select the primitive to convert.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/convert][Convert|Node:sop/convert] tool on the __Model__ tab.
    
    # Choose the geometry type in the __Convert To__ drop-down menu on the operation controls toolbar or the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/convert][Convert|Node:sop/convert] node help.
