= Sink from Objects =

"""Absorbs smoke, fire, liquid, or particle fluid in a container."""

This tool can be used, for example, to simulate a drain in a container of liquid, or an open window in a room full of smoke.

== Using Sink from Objects ==

# Create a geometry object within a container, which will become your sink object.

# Generate fluid to be removed with the sink. You can use either particle or volume based fluid. 

    For more information on creating particle based fluid see the [Icon:DOP/particlefluidemitter][Emit Particle Fluid|emitparticlefluid] help and for more information on creating volume based fluid see the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source][Source from volume|sourcefromvolume] help.

# Select the geometry object to remove the fluid.  

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_sink]Sink from Objects tool on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.

# Choose from the popup dialog whether you want to remove fluid from the __Volume__, __Surface__, or __Points__.
 
# Select the container, and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

This example shows a [sphere|Node:sop/sphere] generating volume based liquid within a [liquid container|/shelf/liquidbox]. An invisible [torus|Node:sop/torus] ([display flag|Node:OBJ/_index] turned off) is the sink object.
