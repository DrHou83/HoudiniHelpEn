= Crown Splash =

"""Creates a FLIP fluid simulation setup to create a crown splash."""

This tool creates a FLIP tank simulation with an droplet falling into the tank.
Gravity has been lowered to create a slow motion appearance. Surface tension has been
enabled to create the crown-like feature.

== Using Crown Splash ==

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/crown_splash] Crown Splash tool on the __Particle Fluids__ tab.
    
    # Select the position for the FLIP fluid box. You can hold ((Alt)) to move off the construction plane.

== Tips ==

* Increasing the resolution by decreasing the particle separation will require adjusting the surface tension parameter in the [Node:dop/flipsolver] to achieve the same overall appearance.

* Increasing the resolution might also require increasing the number of substeps in the [Node:dop/flipsolver] to maintain stability.

* Surface oversamlping will increase the quality of the thin splashes that form. This will also increase the particle count so there is a performance tradeoff to consider.
