"""Creates a smooth muscle surface that can be used to deform a characterâ€™s skin in a realistic way."""

The __2 Point Muscle__ is an asset that contains a muscle which is attached to two points.  The anchor points, as well as a position in the middle, can
be controlled by anchor controls. 

The __3 Point Muscle__ is an asset that contains two muscle objects that are attached from a common root point to separate end points.  The anchor points, as well as a position in the middle, can be controlled by anchor controls. This tool is useful, for example, to create a realistic bicep muscle with the root point attached to the forearm and the two end points connected to two separate points on the shoulder blade.

The __4 Point Muscle__ is an asset that contains three muscle objects that are attached from a common root point to separate end points.  The anchor points, as well as a position in the middle, can be controlled by anchor controls. This tool is useful, for example, to create a realistic tricep muscle with the root point attached to the forearm, one end point connected to the upper-arm, and two end points connected to separate points on the shoulder blade.
