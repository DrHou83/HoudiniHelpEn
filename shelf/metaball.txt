= Metaball =

"""Creates metaballs and metasurfaces. """

This tool is useful for modeling blob-like things that mold together, such as rain drops puddling. It can also be used to create organic shapes, or as a force field such a tornado.

== Placing Metaballs == (includeme)
    
    :task:Place the metaball anywhere in the scene:
        # Click the [Icon:SOP/metaball] [Metaball|/nodes/sop/metaball] tool on the __Create__ tab.
            
        # Move the cursor into the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
            NOTE:
                You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the metaball from the construction plane.
            
        # Click ((LMB)) to place the metaball anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
            If you press ((Enter)) without clicking, Houdini places the metaball at the origin.
        
    :task:Place the metaball at the origin:
        Press ((Ctrl + LMB)) on the [Icon:SOP/metaball] [Metaball|/nodes/sop/metaball] tool on the [shelf|/shelf/].
        
    If you are at the geometry level or have an object selected and you create a [metaball|/nodes/sop/metaball], it will go into the selected object. If you are at the scene level and create a metaball, the viewer and the [network editor|/ref/panes/network] will switch to the geometry level of the selected object. This unique feature allows you to merge multiple metaballs together automatically by creating them sequentially and close together.

    NOTE: 
        Metaballs can be moved once they are placed by either dragging them in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] or changing the values in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
    
    
    == Metaball Handles ==
    There are special handles available at the geometry level for the [Icon:SOP/metaball] [Metaball|/nodes/sop/metaball] object that allow you to stretch and squash it.
    
    # Move to the geometry level by double clicking ((LMB)) the metaball node in the network editor or by clicking the __Jump to Operator__ button on the operation controls toolbar.
    
    # Drag the handles to squash or stretch the metaball.
    
    
    :task:Stretch or squash the metaball along the x-axis:
        Drag the red handle.
            
    :task:Stretch or squash the metaball along the y-axis:
        Drag the green handle. 
        
    :task:Stretch or squash the metaball along the z-axis:
        Drag the blue handle.
