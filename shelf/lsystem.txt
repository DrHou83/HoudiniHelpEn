= L-system =

"""Creates fractal geometry from the recursive application of simple rules. """

This tool is useful for simulating flora such as trees, shrubs, corals etc.

== Placing an L-System in the viewer == (includeme)
    
    :task:Place the L-System anywhere in the scene:
        # Click the [Icon:SOP/lsystem] [L-System|/nodes/sop/lsystem] tool on the __Create__ tab.
            
        # Move the cursor into the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
            NOTE:
                You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the L-System from the construction plane.
            
        # Click ((LMB)) to place the L-System anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. 
            If you press ((Enter)) without clicking, Houdini places the L-System at the origin.
        
    :task:Place the L-System at the origin:
        Press ((Ctrl + LMB)) on the [Icon:SOP/lsystem] [L-System|/nodes/sop/lsystem] tool on the [shelf|/shelf].

    NOTE: 
        L-systems can be moved once they are placed by either dragging them in the scene view or changing the values in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
    
    Default L-Systems can be chosen from the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] Gear drop-down menu at the geometry level.
    
    == L-System Handles ==
    The L-System does not have its own rotation parameters; however, you can rotate it at the object level using the handles in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] or by adding a [Icon:SOP/xform][Transform|Node:sop/xform] node at the geometry level.
    
    NOTE:
        The origin of the L-System is at the base of the tree, not the middle of the object.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/lsystem] [L-System|/nodes/sop/lsystem] node help.
