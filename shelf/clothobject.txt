= Cloth Object =

"""Creates a Cloth Object from SOP Geometry."""

This tool is useful for simulating fabric. For more information on cloth dynamics see [cloth simulation|/dyno/cloth].

NOTE:
    This tool only works on polygonal geometry.

== Using Cloth Object == (includeme)

    # Select the object to make into a cloth object.
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/clothobject][Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject] tool from the __Cloth__ tab.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/clothobject][Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject] node help.

== Tips ==
* If your cloth object is colliding with another object, you should use the [Deforming Collider|/shelf/clothbodycollider] tool for collisions with polygons and the [Rigid Collider|/shelf/rigidcollider] for collisions with volumes.

* If your cloth object is penetrating the surface of an object on collision, you may need to ensure that Use __Volume Based Collision Detection__ is turned off on your [static object|Node:dop/staticobject].
