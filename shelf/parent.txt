    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/parent] Parent tool on the __Modify__ or __Animation__ tab.
        TIP:
            If you do not want the children objects to be transformed when you set the parent object, you must turn on the __Keep position when parenting__ checkbox on the __Transform__ tab of the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms]. 
        
    # Select one or more objects as the child/children object(s) and press ((Enter)) to verify your selection.
        
    # Click ((LMB)) the object you would like to designate as the parent and press ((Enter)) to assign the value.

<!--

The Parent operation is used to parent or unparent objects. Many
children can be parented to another object, or unparented, at once. To
apply this operation, select the child objects and right-click, then
select the parent and right-click, or right-click again without any
selection. If a parent was selected, the children will now be parented,
if no parent was selected, then the children will now be unparented.

The "keep child positions" rules are applied based on the choice from
the Options menu. Depending on the setting, the children will either
"Never" keep their position, "Always" keep their position, or behave
according to the "Keep position when parenting" flag in the object.
