= Make Viscous =

"""Turns on the viscosity parameters of a FLIP Fluid."""

This tool enables the parameters on the __Viscosity__ tab on the [FLIP Fluid Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver].

Viscosity is the thickness and resistance to flow of the particle fluid. A fluid with higher viscosity tends to flow more slowly and appear thicker than one with low viscosity. For example, a substance like honey has high viscosity, whereas a fluid like water has low viscosity.

== Using Make Viscous ==

# Create a [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fluid] [FLIP Fluid Object|/shelf/flipfluidfromobject].
    
# Click the [Icon:SHELF/pour]Make Viscous tool on the __Particle Fluids__ shelf tab.

# Select the [FLIP Fluid Object|/shelf/flipfluidfromobject] to add viscosity to, and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

By default, the __Viscosity Scale__ on the [FLIP Fluid Solver|Node:dop/flipsolver] is set to 1. You can use the slider on the __Viscosity__ tab to adjust the amount of viscosity. This parameter is a scale applied to the Viscosity field after applying the attribute effect, which is useful for adjusting the global amount of viscosity. 

NOTE:
    There is also a __Viscosity__ parameter on the __Physical__ tab of the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject] that you can modify if you want a specific fluid object to have different viscosity.
