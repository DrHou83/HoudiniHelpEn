"""Gives fluid a velocity as soon it touches the pump."""

This tool can be used to give fluid direction. It can also be used to create a spray effect, such as a fire hose.

NOTE:
    This tool only works with volume based fluid.

See [fluid sourcing|/dyno/fluid_sourcing] for information on how the tool transforms the input object into a source for the effect.

== Using Pump from Objects ==

:task:Create a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox], [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Flamefront Container|firebox], and [Icon:SHELF/box_fluid][Liquid Container|liquidbox].

:task:Fill a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/source_from_surface][Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface], [Icon:SHELF/source_from_points][Source from Points|sourcefrompoints], and [Icon:SHELF/source_from_volume][Source from Volume|sourcefromvolume].

:task:Create a pump:
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_pump] Pump from Objects tool.

    # Select the object to generate the velocity and press ((Enter)).
    
    # Select the fluid container and press ((Enter)).
    
:task:Control the added velocity:
    In the DOP network, find the Source Volume node importing the divergence field (named `source_v_from_<<object>>`).
    
    Use the __Scale velocity__ parameter to control the velocity. You can keyframe this value to delay and/or limit the pump time, pulse the pump, etc.

In the example below, the sphere is a liquid source, and the box is a pump:

NOTE:
    If no velocity is set on the pump, it will be turned off. To activate, navigate to the __Velocity Volume__ tab on the `create_v_volume` node and turn on __Add Uniform Velocity__.
