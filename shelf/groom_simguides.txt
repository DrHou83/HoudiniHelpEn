= Simulate Guides =

"""Adds physics simulation to a set of guides."""

This tool adds physics simulation to a set of guides that is either static or has been deformed using the [Deform Guides tool|/shelf/groom_animateguides]. It creates a [Guide Simulate|Node:obj/guidesim] object, which moves a static set of guides with the animated skin.

For more information, see [Guide Simulate|Node:obj/guidesim] or the [Fur Workflow|/fur/workflow] help.
