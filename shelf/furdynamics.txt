= Add Dynamics =

"""Creates a wire simulation to drive a fur object's guide hairs."""

This tool creates a wire simulation to add dynamics to a fur object. In most cases, you will want to use dynamics to allow your fur to move naturally on a character. Rarely will individual strands of hair move rigidly with a character. Applying dynamics allows them to move naturally based on the surrounding forces.

After adding fur with the [Icon:FUR/add_fur][Add Fur|/shelf/groom_addfur] tool and using
the [Icon:FUR/comb][Comb Fur|combfur] tool and paint tools to style the fur,
use the [Icon:FUR/add_dynamics][Add Dynamics|furdynamics] tool to make the
fur reaction the character's motion and external forces.

== Using Wire Object == (includeme)

    # Select the fur objects to make dynamic and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/add_dynamics][Add Dynamics|furdynamics] tool from the __Hair__ tab.
    
    Once you press the [Icon:PLAYBAR/play_forward] play button you will see the fur settle since gravity is added by default when the `AutoDopNetwork` is created.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/wireobject][Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject] node help and the [Icon:DOP/wireglueconstraint][Wire Glue Constraint|Node:dop/wireglueconstraint] node help.

== Tips ==

* You may want to play with the elasticity parameters on the [Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject] created by this tool. 

* You may also want to adjust the bend and stretch stiffness parameters on the [Fur Object|Node:obj/fur] if you want to modify the behavior over the length of each hair. For example, making the hair stiff near the root and floppy near the tips.

* You can also apply forces to the fur such as [Icon:DOP/fan][Fan|Node:dop/fan] or [Icon:DOP/windforce][Wind|Node:dop/fan].

* Once you run the simulation and the fur settles, you may want to use the [Icon:SHELF/wire_initial_pose][Set Initial Pose|/shelf/setinitialpose] tool on the __Wires__ shelf to reassign the starting point in the simulation so that you no longer see the initial effects of gravity on your fur.
