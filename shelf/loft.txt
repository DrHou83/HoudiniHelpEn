= Loft =

"""Builds a skin surface between any number of shape curves in one direction."""

The loft tool is a type of [Icon:SOP/skin][skin|Node:sop/skin] that calculates where the skin should end so that you do not need to use v curves. This tool is useful for quickly skinning [Icon:SOP/curve][curves|/shelf/curve] in one direction.

== Using Loft == (includeme)
    
    # [Draw multiple curves|/shelf/curve] in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
        NOTE:
            All curves must be the same direction.
    
    # Make sure all curves are selected and click the [Icon:SOP/loft] Loft tool on the __Model__ tab.
    
        The last curve that is selected will become the host, and all other curves will be combined into that object.
