== Tips ==

* If the object has velocity attributes, the Fluid Source SOP will convert them
  into a velocity field in the simulation.
  
  To add velocity attributes to the object, add a [Trail SOP|Node:sop/trail]
  and on the Trail node set __Result type__ to "Compute velocity".

* Use the disturbance and turbulence controls on the Pyro Solver's __Shape__
  tab to add detail or change motion.
  
* Use the noise and scale settings on the object's Fluid Source SOP to change
  the emission.
