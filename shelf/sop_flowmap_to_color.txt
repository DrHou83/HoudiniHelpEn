"""Convert a flowmap to color."""

== Overview ==

This node takes the velocity (v) attribute from a mesh and converts it to Tangent Space (or Texture Space) by multiplying it by the TBN Matrix (Tangent Binormal Normal).

It also pushes the velocity attribute to the Color channel in order to streamline the export process.
