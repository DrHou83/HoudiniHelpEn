= Attach Constraint to Rigid Body =

"""Connects an existing soft body constraint to an RBD object."""

You need to create a soft body object ([wire|/shelf/wireobject] or [cloth|/shelf/clothobject]), a [constraint|Node:dop/conrelationship], and an [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD object|/shelf/rbdobject] before you can use this tool. This tool keeps the same distance between
the constraint and the [rigid body|Node:dop/rbdobject]'s pivot point during simulation.

This can be used, for example, to simulate a kite with a tail ([wire|/shelf/wireobject]) blowing in the [wind|/shelf/windforce].

== Using Attach Constraint to Rigid Body ==

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/attach_constraint_rbd] Attach Constraint to Rigid Body tool on the __Wires__ or __Cloth__ tab.

# Select the constraint to parent and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
# Select the [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD object|/shelf/rbdobject] to constrain to and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
