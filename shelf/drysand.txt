= Dry Sand =

"""Creates a grain object from a piece of geometry."""

This tool lets you pick a piece of geometry and fill it with closely packed grains that move independently. It is useful for creating sand that's at rest such as a sandbox or a beach, as well as pouring sand such as an hour glass.

== Using Dry Sand == (includeme)

    # Select the geometry object to convert to dry sand.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/dry_sand][Dry Sand|Node:dop/popgrains] tool on the __Grains__ tab.

NOTE:
        Scaling is an issue for sand because the number of grains are based on how many particles are around it. Changing resolutions may change results.    

== Tips ==

* When making piles of sand, you can edit the __Constraint Iterations__ parameter on the [POP Grains|Node:dop/popgrains] node. This will control how many particles high you want the pile to be. 

        NOTE:
                This is set relatively low by default for speed purposes.
        
        You may also want to increase the __Scale Kinetic Friction__ parameter to make nicer looking piles. Increasing this value will make the sand stick together more.

* Increasing the __Shock Scaling Power__ on the [POP Grains|Node:dop/popgrains] node will tame the initial bounce to create fluffier piles that almost look like snow.

        NOTE:
                Another way to tame the initial bounce is to turn off __Shock Scaling Power__, and turn it on again once the particles hit the ground. This force is needed in order to create piles.

* Turning on __Use OpenCL__ will make the simulations much faster, but with limitations. See the [POP Grains|Node:dop/popgrains] help for more information.
