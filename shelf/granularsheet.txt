"""Fills the surface of an object with densely packed grains and makes constraints to hold them together."""

NOTE:
        This tool is a technical demo of alternate uses for the [POP Grains|Node:dop/popgrains] tool.
        
        
Fills the surface of an object with densely packed grains and makes constraints to hold them together, and is much denser than the [Granular Solid|/shelf/granularsolid]. This provides resistance to bending, resulting in a stretch sheet. It is useful for simulating simple cloth, such as a blanket or drapes.

This tool can be thought of as a simple cloth solver. It results in cloth-like behavior because there are no collisions between particles since they are all right next to each other and constrained. An advantage of using this tool for simple cloth simulations is that it's very stable and faster in certain instances.

NOTE:
        This shelf tool puts down a [Point Deform SOP|Node:sop/pointdeform] in the geometry network, to allow the skin to deform with the grains. It deforms the high resolution mesh according to the animated low resolution mesh.


For more information, see [PBD vs FEM|/grains/about].

NOTE:
        This can also be used on 3D objects, but it is important to note that grains are only generated on the surface. For example, if this tool is used on a box, the box will be hollow.
