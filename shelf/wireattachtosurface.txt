"""Creates soft body constraints between a set of points on a target object and the closest points on a goal object. This is useful for attaching wire to dynamics objects."""

This tool creates soft body constraints between two sets of points on two different objects. You select points on the constrained object and then, optionally, select a goal object and goal points. This tool will link each selected point on the target with the closest point on the goal object. If nothing is selected as the goal object, the tool will constrain to internal animation.

Another use for this tool is to re-attach existing constraints. You can select an existing constraint during the first step in which case the tool will become a re-attachment tool. The second stage will then specify the new goal for the selected constraint.

This tool is designed as a simple way to quickly set up a complex [SBD Constraint|Node:dop/sbdconstraint]. The Attach Wire to Surface tool will automatically assign each chosen point on the wire to a corresponding (closest) point on the goal object. This saves you from having to manually match each point by looking up point numbers.

== Manipulating constraints in the viewport ==
    :task:Create new wire constraints:
	# Click the [Icon:SHELF/sbdattachmentconstraint] Attach Wire to Surface tool on the __Wires__ shelf.
    
	# Select the wire object you want to constrain, then press ((Enter)).

	# Select the points on the selected object you wish to constrain, then press ((Enter)).
    
	# Select the goal object you want to constrain to, then press ((Enter)). If nothing is selected, the tool will constrain to internal animation.
    
	# Select points on the goal object, if you want to restrict the closest-point selection domain, then press ((Enter)). If nothing is selected, the tool will constrain to the closest of all the goal object's points.
        
    :task:Re-attach existing constraints:
	# Click the [Icon:SHELF/sbdattachmentconstraint] Attach Wire to Surface tool on the __Wires__ shelf.
    
	# Select the constraint(s) you want to re-attach, then press ((Enter)).
    
	# Select the goal object you want to constrain to, then press ((Enter)). If nothing is selected, the tool will constrain to internal animation.
    
	# Select points on the goal object, if you wish to restrict the closest-point selection domain, then press ((Enter)). If nothing is selected, the tool will constrain to the closest of all the goal object's points.
    
    NOTE:
	This tool will create a spring SBD constraint by default. You can change it to a pin constraint in the __Type__ dropdown menu on the __Operation Controls__ toolbar.
