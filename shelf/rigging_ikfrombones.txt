"""Allows you to build an IK bone rig (with or without a Twist Affector) from existing bone(s) in the scene."""

The IK from Bones tool allows you to build an IK bone rig (with or without a Twist Affector) from existing bone(s) in the scene. This is useful if you have an imported bone chain that you would like to apply kinematics to, without altering the existing bones. You can also create a reverse bone chain from existing bones.

NOTE:
    You must have at least 1 bone in the scene to use this tool.

    # Click the [Icon:OBJ/autorig_blank] IK from Bones tool on the __Rigging__ tab.

    # Choose the type of IK solver to create: __Basic IK__ or __IK with Twist Affector__.
    
        Basic IK:
            Uses an IK solver. The solution is uniquely defined by the end affector position. Constraint parameters are ignored. 
        IK with Twist:
            Uses a null object for the Inverse Kinematics solver twist parameter. This parameter specifies an additional twist angle to be applied to the solution bone angles.
    
    # Select a naming prefix for the nodes to be created.
    
    # Select a Parent for the bone chain, if any, and press ((Enter)) to complete.
    
    # Select the sequence of bones, press ((Enter)) to complete. You can also click ((RMB)) in the viewport and choose __Accept Selection__.
    
A complete bone rig will be created in the network editor, and placed in a Netbox. Select the green `ikfromobjects_interface` node to see the [rig parameters|Node:obj/autobonechaininterface].
