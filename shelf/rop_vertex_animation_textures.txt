"""Export Different Types of Data to Texture Caches"""

== Overview ==

Exports different types of geometry animation data into textures to then be played back in a vertex shader in a runtime environment.

There are 3 different types of animation that are supported.

Soft:
    Vertex animation on a mesh that doesn't change topology. This is useful for cloth, ocean, FEM, and skinned mesh that need to be played back efficiently in a game engine, possibly spawned by an FX system.

Rigid:
    Vertex animation on a packed primitive mesh made up of multiple chunks. The pivots will be stored in the vertex colors and a position and rotation textures will be exported.

Fluid:
    Vertex animation on a mesh that changes topology. A pass will be made on the geometry to ensure it never goes about the target polycount, and a cloud of triangles will be exported to then be reassembled at runtime with the exported textures.


@parameters

Method:
    Type of data to output.
    
Export Node:
    Node to extract the animation from.

Target Texture Size:
    The maximum allowed texture width. If you have more vertices than the width is allowed, we will automatically append the data vertically and compensate the UVs accordingly.
    
Geometry Path:
    Location of the geometry with the additional UV set created for it.
    
Position Map Path:
    Location of the position texture.
    
Normal Map Path:
    Location of the normal texture.

Start/End:
    Start and End frames for your animation.
