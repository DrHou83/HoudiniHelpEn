"""Lets you simulate a low-resolution solid object and apply the results to high-resolution geometry."""

See [embedding high-res solids|#embed] for more information.

This tool works by modifying the geometry networks and changing parameters on the [Solid object|Node:dop/solidobject]'s __Geometry__ tab.

== Embedding high resolution geometry ==

    # Create the low resolution and high resolution geometry.
    
        For best results, the high resolution geometry should be _at or inside_ the surface of the low resolution geometry.

    # On the __Solid__ tab, use the [Icon:VOP/concrete] [Solid Object shelf tool|/shelf/solidobject] to convert the *low resolution* geometry to a solid finite element (FEM) object.

    # Click the [Icon:DOP/embedhighresobject] Embed Highres Object tool.
       
    # Select the [Geometry object|Node:obj/geo] you want to use as the embedded *high resolution* geometry, then press ((Enter)).
    
    # Select the low resolution solid object, then press ((Enter)).

For parameter help see the [Solid Object node|Node:dop/solidobject] help.
