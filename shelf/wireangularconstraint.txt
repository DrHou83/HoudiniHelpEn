    # Click the [Icon:DOP/wireangularconstraint][Wire Angular Constraint|Node:dop/wireangularconstraint] tool on the __Wires__ tab.
        
    # Select the dynamic object or points to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        NOTE:
            If you select the whole object, the constraint will be placed at the root of the object.
