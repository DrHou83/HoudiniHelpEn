= Create Guides =

"""Creates a guide curves from a skin geometry or manipulates the guides of another groom object."""

This tool allows you to create guides for your character. Unlike the [Add Fur|/shelf/groom_addfur] tool, this tool only creates guides. The [Add Fur|/shelf/groom_addfur] tool creates guides, generates the fur, and also gives the option of picking an animated skin object where you would also get a [Guide Deform|Node:obj/guidedeform].

This tool is useful because most of the time when creating fur, you only work with the guides in order to set up the initial direction and length of the fur. It is also useful to only create guides on certain regions of the character, merge them into one stream, and then perform hair generation for all of them combined. 

For more information, see the [Fur Workflow|/fur/workflow] help.

== Using Create Guides == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/guidegroom]__Create Guides__ tool on the __Hair Utils__ tab.

    # Select the skin geometry you want you want to add guides to and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
        NOTE:
            You can alternatively select an existing groom object.
    
    If you select a skin geometry, the [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] generates guide curves on the geometry.
        
    If you select a groom node, for example another [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] or a [Guide Deform|Node:obj/guidedeform], the created [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] can be used to manipulate the object's guides or its skin attributes.
    
    For specific parameter help see the [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] node help.
