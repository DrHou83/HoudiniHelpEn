"""Deforms geometry based on how you reshape control geometry."""

This tool is useful to deform geometry. However, it can also be used to deform the path of particle systems and create funneling effects.

== Using Lattice == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/lattice][Lattice|Node:sop/lattice] tool on the __Deform__ tab.
    
    # Select the points to deform and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

    # Press ((Enter)) again to create a cage from the object's bounding box or hold ((Alt)) to select a deforming point cloud from another object and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    # Click the transform node in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network].
    
    # Move the points of the cage in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] to deform the shape underneath.
