= Street Crowds Example =

"""Creates an example street scene using the crowds tools."""

This tool creates an example street scene using the crowds tools. There are two
sets of agents in the scene: living humans and zombies. For the living humans,
they wander about until they're close enough to a zombie, at which point
they start to run away. The zombies walk along a path on the street. On the
street there is one set of stop lights which the zombies will stop at if they
are red and continue walking when they are green.
