= Skin =

"""Builds a skin surface between any number of shape curves."""

This tool can be used to create bat wings by dynamically skinning [curves|/shelf/curve].

== Using Skin == (includeme)

    # Draw multiple u and v [curves|/shelf/curve] in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/skin][Skin|Node:sop/skin] tool on the __Model__ tab.
    
    # Select the u curves to skin and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    # Select the v curves to skin and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection
    
        NOTE:
            If you do not select any v curves the tool will act like the [Icon:SOP/loft][Loft|/shelf/loft] tool and predict where the skin should end.
            
    For this tool to work optimally, both u and v curves should be used.
