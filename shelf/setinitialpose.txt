= Set Initial Pose =

"""Sets the initial shape of a simulated wire object based on its current shape."""

This tool is usually used with dynamic [Icon:DOP/wireobject][Wire Objects|/shelf/wireobject] such as fur. It allows you to run the simulation until [gravity|/shelf/gravity] has naturally settled the curves, then reassign the starting point in the simulation so that you no longer see the initial effects of gravity on your objects.

== Using Set Initial Pose ==

# Run the simulation for your [Icon:DOP/wireobject][Wire Objects|/shelf/wireobject] and stop it at the point you want to set as the new initial pose.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/wire_initial_pose]Set Initial Pose tool from the __Wires__ tab.

# Select the dynamic objects to set the initial pose for and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

# Click [Icon:PLAYBAR/frame_first] back to the first frame on the [animation playbar|/anim/playbar] and run your simulation again to see your changes.
