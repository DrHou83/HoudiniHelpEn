= Attach Constraint to Dynamics Point =

"""Connects an existing soft body constraint to a point on a dynamic object."""

You need to create a soft body object (wire or cloth), a [constraint|Node:dop/conrelationship], and another
dynamic object with points to constrain to before you can use this tool. This tool is often used to pin [wires|/shelf/wireobject] to other [wires|/shelf/wireobject].

== Using Attach Constraint to Dynamics Point ==

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/attach_constraint_dynamicspoint]Attach Constraint to Dynamics Point tool on the __Wires__ or __Cloth__ tab.

    # Select the constraint to parent and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    # (optionally) Select the goal object you wish to constrain to, then press ((Enter)). If nothing is selected, the tool will constrain to internal animation.
    
    # (optionally) Select points on the goal object if you want to restrict the closest-point selection domain, then press ((Enter)). If nothing is selected, the tool will constrain to the closest of all the goal object's points.
