"""Pre-fractures the geometry of the selected object, creates a solid finite element (FEM) object, and sets up the `fracturepart` attribute on the pieces so they will stick together."""

This tool sets up several nodes to fracture the selected geometry and turn it into a solid object.

# It adds node to the selected object's geometry network to split it into pieces using [voronoi fracturing|/dyno/shatter].

# It sets the `fracturepart` attribute on the pieces so the pieces themselves will not break up. See [solid object fracturing|/finiteelements/fracturing] for more information.

# It creates a [Solid Object node|Node:dop/solidobject] in the current simulation and sets it up to import the pieces.

See [solid (FEM) simulation|/finiteelements/about] for more information.

TIP:
    This tool is mostly useful to show the nodes used in a pre-fracturing workflow. See the section on solid object fracturing below.
    
    You can also use the `fracturethreshold` attribute to make some parts of a solid object weaker or stronger.
    See [solid object fracturing|/finiteelements/fracturing] for more information.

== Creating a fractured solid object == (includme)

    # Select the geometry to convert to a fractured solid object.
    
    # On the __Solid__ tab, click the [Icon:DOP/fracturedsolidobject] Fractured Solid Object tool.
    
    NOTE:
        Once you convert geometry to a solid object, you can only transform, rotate, and scale it at the first frame.

For parameter help see the [Solid Object node|Node:dop/solidobject] help.
