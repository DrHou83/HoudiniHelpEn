= RBD Angular Spring Constraint =

"""Constrains the rotation of an object so it attempts to rotate naturally, but bounces back to its original rotation."""

It will attempt to rotate naturally when it hits the [ground plane|/shelf/groundplane] but will bob back to its original rotation as a result of the [spring constraint|Node:dop/rbdspringconstraint], which creates a wobbling effect. For example, this is can be used for an arrow hitting the ground. 

You need to create an [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD object|/shelf/rbdobject] to apply this constraint to before you can use this tool.

NOTE:
        This constraint will not work with packed primitives. However, you can achieve the equivalent using a [constraint network|Node:dop/constraintnetwork], such as the one created by the [Icon:PARTS/glue][Glue Adjacent|/shelf/gluenetwork] shelf tool.

== Using RBD Angular Spring Constraints == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/rbdangularspringconstraint][RBD Angular Spring Constraint|Node:dop/rbdangularspringconstraint] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.
    
    # Select the object to constrain and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    # Select the position for the angular spring constraint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
        NOTE:
            You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the constraint from the construction plane.
    
    # Set the __Strength__ and __Dampening__ on the __Spring__ tab in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

    NOTE:
        To parent to another object, use the [Parent Constraint|/shelf/parentconstraint] tool.
        
For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/rbdangularspringconstraint][RBD Angular Spring Constraint|Node:dop/rbdangularspringconstraint] dynamics node help.
        
== Moving an RBD Angular Spring Constraint ==
    
# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].
    
# Click ((LMB)) the constrained object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
    
# Click ((RMB)) the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button and turn on the __Dynamics Modifiers__ checkbox.

# Click ((LMB)) the constraint you want to edit and press ((Enter)) to display the [transformation handles|/basics/handles#basic-handles].

== Switching to the dynamics level ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the constrained object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
