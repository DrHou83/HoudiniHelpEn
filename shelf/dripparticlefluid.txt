= Drip Fluid =

"""Creates a FLIP fluid simulation setup to create a dripping fluid effect."""

This tool creates a dripping FLIP simulation. A fluid emitter creates a continuous stream and surface tension forces form droplets from the stream. Gravity has been lowered to create a slow motion appearance. Surface tension has been enabled to generate the individual droplets.

== Using Drip Fluid ==

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/drip] Drip Fluid tool on the __Particle Fluids__ tab.
    
    # Select the position for the FLIP fluid emitter. You can hold ((Alt)) to move off the construction plane.

== Tips ==

* Increasing the resolution by decreasing the particle separation will require adjusting the surface tension parameter in the [Node:dop/flipsolver] to achieve the same overall appearance.

* Increasing the resolution might also require increasing the number of substeps in the [Node:dop/flipsolver] to maintain stability.

* As the droplets fall, they gain velocity. If they fall too quickly, the surface tension forces can become unstable. It might be necessary to increase the number of substeps in the [Node:dop/flipsolver] to maintain stability.
