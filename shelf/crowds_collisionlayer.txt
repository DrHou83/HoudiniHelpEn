= Collision Layer =

"""Creates a new agent layer that is suitable for collision detection."""

This tool creates a new layer that consists of simple shapes such as capsules and boxes, and is suitable for use as an agent's collision layer.
For example, this layer can be used for ragdoll simulations using the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver].

== Using Collision Layer ==

    # Click the Collision Layer tool on the __Crowds__ tab.
    # Select the agent primitive to add a collision layer to and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    # Left click on a bone marker to attach a collision shape to it. Use the box handle ( ((B)) ) and orientation handle ( ((O)) ) to adjust the size and alignment of the collision shape. Press ((Z)) to cycle the collision shape type. Press ((Delete)) to remove the selected collision shape.
