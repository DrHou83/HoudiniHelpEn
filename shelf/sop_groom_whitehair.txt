= Add White Hairs =

"""Adds the required attribute to mark hairs as white hairs in the standard hair shader."""

This tool masks a percentage of hairs and creates a `whitehair` attribute. This attribute is picked up by the hair shader. Any curve with the attribute set to `1` is regarded as a white hair and assigned the __White Hair__ color specified on the shader.

For more information, see the [Fur Workflow|/fur/workflow] help.
