RBD Packed Objects are useful for large simulations since they are much faster, use less memory, and are smaller to write to disk. They can also be influenced by [POP Forces|/dopparticles/forces], such as drag. Packed Objects can not interact with other solvers such as cloth and fluids. They also only work with [Constraint Networks|Node:dop/constraintnetwork], such as the one created by the [Icon:PARTS/glue][Glue Adjacent|/shelf/gluenetwork] shelf tool.
