= Detach Constraint =

"""(Re)Connects an existing soft body constraint to a point in world space."""

You need to create a soft body object (wire or cloth) and a [constraint|Node:dop/conrelationship] before you can use this tool. This tool is usually used with a [spring constraint|Node:dop/springconrel] since
it changes the constraint position at the second frame. It creates tension and pulls the spring so that it has a sharper effect. This tool also allows you to [animate|/anim] the constraint position.

== Using Detach Constraint ==

# Select the constraint to detach.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/detach_constraint]Detach Constraint tool on the __Wires__ or __Cloth__ tab.

NOTE:
    You can move the world space position using the transform handles.
