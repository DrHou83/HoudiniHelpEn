= Part Hair =

"""Lets you interactively push hair away from your stroke."""

This tool allows you to interactively push hair away from your stroke. This tool takes any hair that is inside the brush radius and pushes it away from the center of your stroke. It is useful for creating parting in hair.

TIP:
        You may want to increase the __Randomize__ parameter to make the part a little less perfect and more natural looking.

== Using Part Hair == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/part_hair][Part Hair|Node:obj/guidegroom] tool on the __Grooming__ tab.

    # Hold ((LMB)) and drag over the area to create the part.

    TIP:
        Scrolling the mouse wheel or holding ((Shift)) while dragging ((LMB)) will let you resize your brush.

    For specific parameter information, see the [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] help.

* You can also create parting by using the [Add Parting|/shelf/addparting] tool on the __Hair__ tab. This tool sets attributes on the skin so that you don't manually have to groom the hair. See the [Add Parting|/shelf/addparting] tool for more information.
