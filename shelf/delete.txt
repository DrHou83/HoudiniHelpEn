= Delete =

"""Deletes input geometry by entity number, bounding volume, primitive/point/edge normals, and/or degeneracy."""

This tool deletes the selected object at the object level, and allows you to delete components of an object at the geometry level. A [Icon:SOP/dissolve][Dissolve|Node:sop/dissolve] is used if edges or points are selected, and a [Icon:SOP/blast][Blast|Node:sop/blast] is used if primitives are selected.
