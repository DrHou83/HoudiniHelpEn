"""Use a curve to guide a flowmap."""

== Overview ==

The Flowmap Guide node allows you use a curve as an means to direct the flowmap. It bends the flow field along the direction of the curve. 

This is useful to procedurally comb the direction of the flow field without being geometry dependent like the Comb operator.
