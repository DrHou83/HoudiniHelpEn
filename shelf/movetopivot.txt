= Move Center to Pivot =

"""Moves an object's bounding box center to its pivot."""

This tool is useful for recentering an object to the pivot once you have altered the original geometry. You can get a rough idea of where the center pivot will appear by changing the [view options|/basics/view] to display __Wireframe Bounding Box__.

== Using Move Center to Pivot ==

    # Select the object(s) whose center you wish to move.
        
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/movetopivot] __Move Center to Pivot__ tool on the __Modify__ shelf.
