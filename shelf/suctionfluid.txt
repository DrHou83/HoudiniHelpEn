The Suction Fluid tool creates a force at the fluid surface to draw it toward a target object. This is useful for creating a suction-like force and filling a target object with fluid.

NOTE:
    The fluid must be a FLIP fluid. Suction fluid will not work with volume fluids.
    
The Suction Fluid tool will create two nodes, `antigravity` and `suctionforce`, in the [Node:dop/flipsolver]. The `antigravity` node reduces gravity inside the suction force range of influence to reduce the strength of the suction force required to lift upwards. The `suctionforce` node controls the strength of force (using __Suction Strength__) and how far the influence of the force reaches (using __Outside Distance__).

The voxel size used in the collision source is initially set to the resolution of the FLIP simulation. This might need to be adjusted to better represent the target object.

Thin features in the target object will require a high resolution fluid simulation to full represent them with the fluid surface.

== Using Suction Fluid ==

	# Create a FLIP fluid simulation and a target object.
	
	# Click the [Icon:SHELF/suctionfluid] Suction Fluid tool on the __Particle Fluids__ tab.

	# Select the target object for the FLIP fluid to be drawn to, and press ((Enter)).

	# Select the FLIP fluid to apply suction to, and press ((Enter)).
		
    The following example shows the rubber toy as the target object of the suction fluid tool. The fluid is drawn up into the object, filling it with FLIP particles and creating a fluid representation of the target object.

TIP:
    Using a wide __Outside Distance__ will target more particles but also tends to full up the region outside the target object. Reducing __Outside Distance__ once the target is full is a good approach for matching the target object surface with FLIP fluid.
