"""Converts geometry into a cloud, complete with lighting."""

== Overview ==

This tool converts the selected geometry into a cloud-like [VDB volume|/model/volumes] 
complete with lighting. This tool can be useful for creating an individual 
cloud, or simply as a demo for the lower-level tools [Icon:SOP/cloud] [Cloud|Node:sop/cloud], [Icon:SOP/cloudnoise] [Cloud Noise|Node:sop/cloudnoise], and [Icon:SOP/cloudlight] [Cloud light|Node:sop/cloudlight].

== How to ==

:task:Create a cloud-like volume:
    # Select the geometry object you want to convert to a cloud volume.

    # On the __Cloud FX__ shelf tab, click [Icon:SHELF/cloudrig] Cloud Rig.
    
    The rig tool sets up several nodes in the scene.
    
    * The Cloud Rig tool hides the original geometry object and creates a new object (`cloud_from_<<name>>`) that references the geometry from the object you selected.
    
    * It adds a [Cloud|Node:sop/cloud], [Cloud Noise|Node:sop/cloudnoise], and [Cloud Light|Node:sop/cloudlight] inside the new geometry object. See the help pages for those nodes for how to use their parameters.
    
    * It adds a key "sun" light (`sunlight`) and environment light with a sky texture (`skylight`) to light the cloud.
    
    * It assigns the [cloud material|/gallery/shop/vopmaterial/cloud] to the new object.
    
    * It wires a reference to the sun light's position into the [Cloud Light|Node:sop/cloudlight] node. The cloud light node uses the light position to add attributes to the cloud that are then used by the shader to simulate light scattering through the cloud.
