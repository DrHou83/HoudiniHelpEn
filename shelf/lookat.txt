= Look At =

"""Makes an object automatically point at another object."""\

This tool will modify the orientation of an object to make it point at at target. It is often used to make [Icon:OBJ/light][Lights|Node:obj/hlight] or [Icon:OBJ/camera][Cameras|Node:obj/cam] follow a moving object. It's also useful to control where a character's eyes will point.

== Using Look At ==
            
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/lookat] Look At tool on the __Constraints__ tab.
                
    # Select the object to create the look at constraint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
                
    # Select the look at object and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
    # Select the look up object and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. If you don't have a look up object, press ((Enter)) without making a selection.

This tool creates a new tab on the object called __Constraints__ as well as a `constraints` CHOP Network inside the object.
