= Carve =

"""Slices, cuts or extracts points or cross-sections from a primitive."""

This tool works best with NURBS, meshes, and Beziers because it treats the whole object as a primitive, unlike polygons which have many separate primitives. For example, you can use this tool to slice up a watermelon, or to slice up a curve and animate the cut over time.
