= Extract =

"""Creates a second object from a selected object or selected components."""

This tool is useful for extracting geometry so you can apply [light|/render/lights] and [rendering|/render] separately. For example, windows on a skyscraper.

== Using Extract ==
        
    # Select the object or faces of the object you wish to duplicate.
        
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/extract_object] Extract tool on the __Modify__ tab. 
        
    To split the extraction from the original, unlock the objects at the geometry level in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network].
