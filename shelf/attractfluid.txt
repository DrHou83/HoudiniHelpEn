= Attract Fluid =

"""Draws fluid toward a target."""

The Attract Fluid tool draws fluid toward a target object. This is useful for simulating a vacuum or any kind of suction force. It can also be used to direct the movement of smoke to condense around a shape. For example, simulating a cloud of smoke taking the form of a genie.

NOTE:
    The fluid must be a volume fluid. Attract fluid will not work with SPH or FLIP fluids.

== Using Attract Fluid ==

    # Create a fluid container, a source object, and a target object. You can use either [Source from Volume|/shelf/sourcefromvolume], [Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface], or [Source from Points|/shelf/sourcefrompoints].

    NOTE:
        The source and target objects have to be inside the same fluid container.

    # Click [Icon:SHELF/attractfluid]__Attract Fluid__ on the __Volume Fluids__ tab of the shelf.
    
    # Select the target object for the fluid to attract to, then press ((Enter)).
    
    # Select the fluid container that contains the source and target objects, then press ((Enter)).

    # Choose from the popup dialog whether you want to attract to a __Volume__, __Surface__, or __Points__.
