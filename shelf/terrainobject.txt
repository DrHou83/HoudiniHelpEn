= Terrain Object =

"""Creates a Terrain Object from SOP Geometry."""

This tool was designed to convert thin grid-like objects into a ground surface similar to the [ground plane|groundplane]. Unlike the ground plane tool, the surface that the terrain object creates is only as big as the original geometry. It is often used to convert a deformed [grid|grid] into irregular terrain.

== Using Terrain Objects == (includeme)
    
    # Select the object to convert to a terrain object.
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/terrainobject][Terrain Object|Node:dop/terrainobject] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

    NOTE: 
        You can [transform, rotate, scale|/basics/handles], and [keyframe|/anim/basics] the terrain object at various frames.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:DOP/terrainobject][Terrain Object|Node:dop/terrainobject] dynamics node help.
    
== Switching to the dynamics level ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the terrain object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
