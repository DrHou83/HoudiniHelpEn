= Group =

"""Creates simulation object groups."""

Groups can be used for two main purposes. First, affector relationships can only be set up between groups of objects. See [Icon:DOP/affector][Affector|/nodes/dop/affector] help for more information on affector relationships. Second, object groups can be used instead of complicated object masks to refer to sets of objects.
