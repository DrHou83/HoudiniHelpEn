"""Converts an object into a collision volume that can interact with smoke/fire/liquid in a fluid container."""

See [fluid sourcing|/dyno/fluid_sourcing] for information on how the tool transforms the input object into a collision volume for the effect.

== Using Collide with Objects ==

:task:Create a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/box_smoke][Smoke Container|smokebox], [Icon:SHELF/box_fire][Flamefront Container|firebox], and [Icon:SHELF/box_fluid][Liquid Container|liquidbox].

:task:Fill a fluid container:
    See [Icon:SHELF/source_from_surface][Source from Surface|sourcefromsurface], [Icon:SHELF/source_from_points][Source from Points|sourcefrompoints], and [Icon:SHELF/source_from_volume][Source from Volume|sourcefromvolume].

:task:Create a collision volume:
    # Select the object you want to turn into a collision volume.
    
    # On the __Populate containers__ tab, click the [Icon:SHELF/make_collision] Collide with Objects tool.
    
    # Select the fluid container you want to collide and press ((Enter)).

== Tips ==

* The shelf tool adds a [Fluid Source surface node|Node:sop/fluidsource] to the object to convert its geometry into an appropriate volume, then imports the volume into the DOP network using a [Source Volume node|Node:dop/sourcevolume].

* Most "populate containers" defaults are configured for a sphere with a radius of 1 unit. For much smaller or larger volumes, you may need to change settings on the [Fluid Source surface node|Node:sop/fluidsource] created by the shelf tool. The __Sample Radius__, __Edge Location__ and __Feather Length__ parameters give extensive control over how everything is sampled into a volume.
