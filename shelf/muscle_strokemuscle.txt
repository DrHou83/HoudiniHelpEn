= Stroke Muscle =

"""Creates a rigged muscle by stroking a curve onto a skin object."""

This tool allows you to create a rigged muscle asset by drawing directly on the skin of a character. It prompts you to select a skin object and lets you stroke a curve over the skin. The resulting muscle will stretch along the full length of the curve you draw.

NOTE:
    Creating a muscle this way will leave the endpoints unconnected. You can connect the head and tail anchors later using the [Attach to Bones|/shelf/muscle_attachmuscles] shelf tool.

NOTE:
    The capture pose for the muscle is automatically set to match the stroked position.  If muscle handles are further adjusted by repositioning them in the viewport, the capture position will need to be reset by navigating to the __Capture/Deform__ tab and pressing the __Set Capture Pose__ button.

== Creating Stroked Muscles == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:OBJ/muscle] [Stroke Muscle|Node:obj/riggedmuscle] tool on the __Muscles__ shelf tab.
    
    # Select the skin object to draw your stroke on and press ((Enter)).

    # Stroke a curve onto your skin geometry.  You may stroke multiple times until you are satisfied with the placement of your muscle.  Each time you draw a stroke, the muscle will be redrawn.
        
        TIP:
            While the stroke state is active, you can adjust the muscle radius using the mouse wheel, or ((Shift + MMB)) dragging.
            
	# After a stroke has been drawn, you may adjust the depth of the drawn muscle relative to your skin surface by adjusting the __Depth__ parameter.

    # Once you are satisfied with the shape and position of the stroked curve, press the __Accept Stroke__ or __Accept and Create New Stroked Muscle__ button to save your stroke as the current pose in the muscle parameters.  You will still be able to modify the position of the rig handles to further refine or shape your muscle.
    
    TIP:
        You can also press ((Enter)) to complete the stroke and return to object mode, or press ((Q)) to repeat the operation (which will complete the current muscle stroke and begin a new one).

    TIP:
        Use the [Mirror|/shelf/mirror] shelf tool to create muscles for the other side of a character. They will be created unattached, but can be attached using the [Attach to Bones|/shelf/muscle_attachmuscles] shelf tool.
