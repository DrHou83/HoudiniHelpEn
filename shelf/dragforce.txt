= Drag Force =

""" Applies force and torque to objects that resists their current direction of motion."""

This tool is used to slow down the velocity of objects that have other forces applied to it. Drag force can also be used to simulate things moving through water or other high density spaces.

== Using Drag Force == (includeme)
    
    # Select the dynamic object to apply drag force to.
    
    # Click the [Icon:DOP/drag][Drag Force|Node:dop/drag] tool on the __Drive Simulation__ tab.
    
    NOTE:
        Drag force is simply a predefined force node whose force and direction can be altered in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
