= UV Pelt =

"""Relaxes UVs by pulling them out toward the edges of the texture area."""

Make sure the object has UVs and a [Icon:SHOP/vopmaterial][Material|/shade/] assigned to it. 

You also need to have a texture projected onto a [model|/model/] in order to use the UV Pelt tool. This tool allows you to manually select the boundaries of the UVs where you want the surface to unwrap.

== Using UV Pelt == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/uvpelt][UV Pelt|Node:sop/uvpelt] tool on the __Texture__ tab.
    
    # Select the edges that will form the boundary of the pelt.
        TIP:
            You can easily select loops of edges using the [Edge Loop|/shelf/edgeloop] tool.

    # Press ((Enter)) to unwrap your selection.

    You can scale the pelt by increasing the __Boundary Springs__ in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms]. You can also use [UV Edit|uvedit] to move the UVs.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/uvpelt][UV Pelt|Node:sop/uvpelt] node help.
