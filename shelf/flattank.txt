= Flat Tank =

"""Creates a FLIP fluid simulation of a flat tank with a boundary layer."""

This tool creates a FLIP tank simulation of a flat tank of particles similar to the [FLIP Tank|/shelf/fliptank] tool, but with the addition of a _boundary layer_ of particles that helps suppress reflections at the edge of the tank and maintain the water level over time.  The boundary layer also allows the tank to track a moving object, simulating only the area around the object. 

TIP:
    For more information, see the [differences between ocean tank types|/shelf/ocean_differences] help page.

== Using Flat Tank ==
    
# Click the [Icon:SHELF/flat_tank] __Flat Tank__ tool on the __Oceans__ tab to create a tank.

# Select an animated object to follow and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection. If no object is selected, you will be prompted to place a static tank.

For specific parameter information, see the [Ocean Source|Node:sop/oceansource] help page.

== Tips ==

* It is useful to parent your trackable object with a [Null Object|Node:obj/null] so that you can create a more complex animation on the object and it will still follow your simple animation of the null.

        You can also parent cameras and lights to the moving null by connecting them to the output of the [Null Object|Node:obj/null] and enabling the __Keep position when parenting__ checkbox on the light or camera object.

* The __Particle Separation__ on the [Ocean Source|Node:sop/oceansource] controls the resolution of you ocean. The lower the number, the closer together the particles will be.

* The __Size__ parameter controls the size, shape, and depth of the tank. When you change the size, you will see a handle in the viewport which you can drag to manually set the size and depth of your tank.
