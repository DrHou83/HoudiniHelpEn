"""Emits particles from the edges and surfaces of separating fractured rigid bodies."""

This tool is used to emit particles from fractured rigid body objects as they separate from each other.  Emission sources are created along the edges and surfaces of the fractured rigid bodies and emit debris particles for a specified duration after separation has been detected.

This tool creates three nodes in the obj network.

See [this example file|/examples/nodes/dop/rbdfracturedobject/ShatterDebris].

== Using Debris == (includeme)

# Create an object and apply a [Icon:SOP/break][Node:sop/break] or [Icon:SOP/shatter][Shatter|Node:sop/voronoifracture] to it using the tools on the __Model__ shelf.

# Convert the object to an [Icon:DOP/rbdfracturedobject][Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject] or an [Icon:DOP/rbdglueobject][Node:dop/rbdglueobject].

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/debris][Debris|Shelf:debris] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

# Select a one or more rigid body objects and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

== Understanding the network of nodes ==

This tool creates three nodes `/obj` network.

=== Debris Source ===

This is where the debris comes from, and controls when the debris sources are active.

TIP:
    Consider limiting the debris source to interior edges and surfaces of fractured geometry through the `Group` parameter on the [Debris Source|Node:sop/debrissource] node.

=== Debris Sim ===

This where the debris simulated, and where you can modify the animation.

- The [Node:dop/popsource] picks up points and uses them as sources to generate particles.

- The [Node:dop/popreplicate] node controls the speed and direction that the debris will be birthed.

=== Import Debris ===

This is the result of `debris_sim` imported into a SOP network.
