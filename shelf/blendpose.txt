= Blend Pose =

"""Allows you to create a series of relationships between several objects, where target objects will react to driver objects."""

(In Maya(tm) this is called _Set Driven Key_.)

This tool is useful for creating simple [animation|/anim], such as a lever that makes a door open and close.

== Using Blend Pose ==
            
    # Click the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/blendpose] Blend Pose tool on the __Modify__ or __Animation__ tab.
                
    # Click ((LMB)) the target object(s).
                
    # Click ((LMB)) the driver object(s). 
                
        The Blend Pose menu will open.
                
    # Click __Add__ to set the first pose.
                
    # Alter the objects in the scene view and click __Add__ on the Blend Pose window to set the second pose.
                
        Repeat this step as many times as needed to set multiple poses.
                
    # Change Blend from Inactive to Active to view your reactive animation.

*Example:* Lever being used to control a door swinging.
                
You can modify your poses by scrolling to them in the Blend Pose window, making your changes in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview], and clicking __Update__. You can also remove a pose by scrolling to it and clicking __Remove__ in the Blend Pose window.
            
NOTE:
    Make sure the Blend is set to Inactive when you are making changes in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
