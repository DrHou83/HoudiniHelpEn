:task:Revolve a curve:
    # Draw a [Icon:SOP/curve][curve|Node:sop/curve] in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

    # Make sure the curve is selected and click the [Icon:SOP/revolve][Revolve|Node:sop/revolve] tool on the __Model__ tab.
    
:task:Revolve multiple curves:
    # Draw curves in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

    # Make sure all of the curves are selected and click the [Icon:SOP/revolve][Revolve|Node:sop/revolve] tool on the __Model__ tab.
    
    NOTE:
        Revolving multiple [curves|Node:sop/curve] at the same time will merge the curve into a single object.    

=== Revolve Handles ===

There are special handles available at the geometry level for the revolved curve object that allow you to change the rotation axis.
