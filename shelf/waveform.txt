"""Creates a waveform shape out of surface geometry"""

This tool creates a wave shape in your geometry. It is useful for creating a moving wave in a particle fluid simulation. You can change the orientation and shape of the wave by using the handles in the viewport.

NOTE:
    This tool works well with [Icon:SHELF/sculptedparticlefluid][Sculpted Particle Fluid|/shelf/sculptedparticlefluid].

== Using Waveform ==

# Click the [Icon:SOP/waveform][Waveform|Node:sop/waveform] tool on the __Deform__ shelf tab.

# Select a fluid surface object and press ((Enter)) to complete your selection.

NOTE:
    The blue arrow indicates the direction the wave will move in the particle fluid simulation.
