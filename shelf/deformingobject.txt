= Deforming Object =

"""Creates a DOPs collision object from deforming SOP Geometry."""

This tool creates a [Collision Source|Node:sop/collisionsource] SOP to prepare deforming geometry for importing into DOPs collisions with a [Static Object|Node:dop/staticobject] DOP.

== Using Deforming Objects == (includeme)
    
    # Select the deforming geometry to convert to a collision object.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/deforming_object]Deforming Object tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

For specific parameter help see the [Collision Source SOP|Node:sop/collisionsource] and [Static Object DOP|Node:dop/staticobject] node help pages. 
    
== Switching to the dynamics level ==

# Click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics]Dynamics Select Mode button on the [selector and handle controls toolbar|/basics/select].

# Click ((LMB)) the static object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
