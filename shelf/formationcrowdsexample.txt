= Formation Crowds Example =

"""Creates an example formation scene using the crowds tools."""

The setup creates an army of agents using the crowds tools.
The middle part of the army starts moving and then splits into two formations.
One goes to the left, and the other group keeps marching forward and slowly
changes formation to a wedge shape.
