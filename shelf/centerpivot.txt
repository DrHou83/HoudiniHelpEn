= Move Pivot to Center =

"""Moves the pivot of an object to the center of the bounding box for that object."""

This tool is useful for recentering the center pivot once you have altered the original geometry. You can get a rough idea of where the center pivot will appear by changing the [view options|/basics/view] to display __Wireframe Bounding Box__.

== Using Move Pivot to Center ==
        
    # Select the object(s) whose pivot you would like to move.
        
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/center_pivot] __Move Pivot to Center__ tool on the __Modify__ shelf.
