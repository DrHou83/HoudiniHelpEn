Creates [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] and [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen] objects for the selected skin. This is typically the best starting point for any groom.

This selected skin geometry must be static. An animated version of the same skin can be selected as well. When this is done, the tool also creates a [Guide Deform object|Node:obj/guidedeform], which moves the output of [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] (i.e. groomed guides) with the animated skin. The [Hair Generate|Node:obj/hairgen] object generates animated hair from these guides.

For more information, see the [Fur Workflow|/fur/workflow] help.

== Using Add Fur == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/add_fur]__Add Fur__ tool on the __Hair Utils__ tab.
    
    # Select the static geometry object to which you want to add fur and press ((Enter)).
    
    # Select the animated skin geometry (if any), and press ((Enter)). If you don't have animated skin geometry, press ((Enter)) without making a selection.

    Once the fur is applied to the object, you can use the parameters on the [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] node to style it.
