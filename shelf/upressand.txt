= Upres Sand =

"""Takes each particle from your original simulation and replaces it with a cluster of new ones."""

This tool takes each particle from your original simulation and replaces it with 10 new ones. This will give you more sand without having to simulate more sand. It will essentially create a bunch of particles around the existing particle, and will maintain the same motion as the original particle. The simulation will be exactly the same (no new motion) but is very useful wet sand situations to add extra texture.

    # Select the geometry object to convert to RBD grains.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/sand_upres][Upres Sand|Node:dop/popreplicate] tool on the __Grains__ tab.
    
    The following shows the before and after rendered images of a squab rising up from being buried under the sand.

    TIP:
        You can control how many particles are generated using the __Points per Point__ parameter on the [Point Replicate|Node:dop/popreplicate] DOP. The default is 10 particles for each original particle.
    
For specific parameter information, see the [Point Replicate|Node:dop/popreplicate] help.
