"""Creates a Smoke object from SOP Geometry and connects it to a Pyro solver's Fuel Object input."""

This tool converts the selected object into a [Smoke object|Node:dop/smokeobject] and then connects that smoke object into the "fuel object" input of the solver for the Pyro container you select, effectively converting the object into a volume of fuel inside the Pyro container.

Fuel From Object does the same thing as Smoke From Object and Liquid From Object: it sets the _initial_ fuel conditions from the given object. If you display the fuel field, you should see a big chunk of extra fuel corresponding to the object. However, this fuel will not ignite until the flames reach it, so it may appear to do nothing.

Use the [Source from object|/shelf/sourcefromobjects] tool to create a fuel emitter from an object.

== Using Fuel from Object == (includeme)
    
    # Select the geometry object to convert to fuel.
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_fuel]Fuel from Object tool on the __Volume fluids__ tab.

    # Select the Pyro container you want to add the fuel to, then press ((Enter)).

For specific parameter help see the [Smoke Object|Node:dop/smokeobject] and [Pyro solver|Node:dop/pyrosolver] node help.
