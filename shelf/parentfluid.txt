= Parent Fluid =

"""Parents a fluid container to objects in your scene."""

This tool is useful for parenting fluid containers to moving objects in your scene. For example, a character carrying a fish bowl and dropping it, or an oil tanker driving on a hilly road. The forces of the animated object will be applied to the fluid in the container.

The fluid must be a volume fluid. Parent Fluid will not work with SPH or FLIP fluids.

== Using Parent Fluid ==

    # Create a fluid container and an object to parent the fluid container to.

    # Click [Icon:DOP/parentfluid]__Parent Fluid__ on the __Volume Fluids__ tab of the shelf, select the fluid container to apply to your model, then press ((Enter)).
    
    # Select the object to parent the fluid to, then press ((Enter)).
