"""Constrain a selection of points to animated target positions."""

This tool constrains the points of a finite element object to a target animation. This tool works with both the Solid Object and the Hybrid Object.

    :task:Create new finite element constraints:
	# Click the [Icon:SHELF/cloth_follow_animation] Constrain Points to Target tool on the __Solid__ shelf.
    
	# Select the finite element object you want to constrain, then press ((Enter)).

	# Select the points on the selected object you want to constrain, then press ((Enter)).
