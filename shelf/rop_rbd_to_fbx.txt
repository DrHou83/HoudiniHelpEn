"""Export RBD sequence to FBX."""

== Overview ==

Export a packed rigid body simulation into an FBX file readable by most game engines and other software. 

Generates a new geometry node per piece and transfers the animation data from the points up to the object level. 

You can also work with file caches and does not require the original simulation data.
