"""Stitch two pieces of cloth or a piece of cloth to points on a dynamics body."""

This tool creates a cloth stitch constraint between two sets of points on two different objects. You select points on the constrained object and then select a goal object and (optional) goal points. This tool will link each selected point on the target with the closest point on the goal object.

The Cloth Stitch tool will automatically assign a closest point on the goal object to each selected point on the constrained object. This saves you from having to manually match each point by looking up point numbers.

== Manipulating constraints in the viewport ==
    :task:Create new cloth constraints:
	# Click the [Icon:DOP/clothstitchconstraint] Cloth Stitch tool on the __Cloth__ shelf.
    
	# Select the cloth object you want to constrain, then press ((Enter)).

	# Select the points on the selected object you want to constrain, then press ((Enter)).

            TIP:
                You can select one edge and press ((L)) to loop forward and select all edges. Pressing ((R)) reverses the direction of the arrow and pressing ((F)) marches the selection forward once an edge is selected.
	
	# Select the goal object you want to constrain to, then press ((Enter)). If nothing is selected, the tool will constrain to internal animation.
    
	# Select points on the goal object, if you want to restrict the closest-point selection domain, then press ((Enter)).
