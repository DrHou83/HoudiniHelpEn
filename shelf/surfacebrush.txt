= Surface Brush =

"""Lets you interactively groom hair along the surface of your geometry."""

This tool allows you to interactively groom hair along the surface of your geometry. This tool is different from [Icon:FUR/screen_brush][Comb on Screen|/shelf/screenbrush], as it allows you to groom along the surface of the geometry. The [Comb on Screen|/shelf/screenbrush] shelf tool lets you groom the hair freely in the viewport. 

This tool is useful for shorter hair that is close to the body of your character, such as grooming fur on the back of an animal.
