= Interact =

"""Applies forces between particles."""

This tool uses the [POP Interact|Node:dop/popflock] node to makes particles attract or repel other particles. Forces to particles based on their closest neighbors. This can be used to keep particles apart or to make them match velocities.

        # Create a particle system along the curve using the [Icon:POP/location][Location|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] or [Icon:POP/source][Source|/shelf/dynamics_popsource] shelf tools.
