"""Lets you interactively reshape a surface by brushing."""

The deform mode lets you push or pull the geometry along its normals and the smooth mode smooths out the geometry. This tool is useful for adding detail to [models|/model].

== Using Sculpt == (includeme)

    # [Select|/basics/select] the object you want to sculpt, _or_ in [component mode|/basics/select], select a subset of the points in an object.
    
        When you select a subset of points, the [Icon:SOP/sculpt][Sculpt|Node:sop/sculpt] tool will only be able to modify the selected points. The unselected points will be protected from [brushing|/basics/brush].
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/sculpt] [Sculpt|Node:sop/sculpt] tool on the __Model__ tab.
    
    # Do any of the following:
    
        - Shift-drag to change the size of the brush, or use the __Radius__ control on the operation toolbar (across the top of the viewer).
        
        - Right click to assign operations to ((LMB)) and ((MMB)), change the brush shape, and set other options.
        
        - __FD__ on the toolbar controls the amount of displacement caused by brushing with ((LMB)). __BD__ controls the amount caused by brushing with ((MMB)). These are the same as the parameters in the __LMB Displacement__ and __MMB Displacement__ sub-tabs of the __Operation__ tab in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
        
        - __Opacity__ controls how much deformation or smoothing the tool will do with each brush-stroke. This is the same as the __Opacity__ parameter on the __Brush__ tab in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
        
        - Drag across the surface with ((LMB)) or ((MMB)) to perform the assigned operation on the selected points.

    TIP:
        The [brush|/basics/brush] casts through the surface and sometimes you may find that strokes on the surface deform points on the opposite side of the surface.

        You can minimize this by enabling the __Depth__ parameter on the __Brush__ tab in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms]. The __Depth__ values limit how far _above_ and _below_ the surface the brush will cast.
        
        You can copy the __Radius__ parameter and paste it as a relative reference into both __Depth__ fields to create a spherical/cubical (depending on brush shape) brush. This is usually sufficient to eliminate problems casting through, unless you are using a large brush size.
