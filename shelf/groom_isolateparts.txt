= Isolate Groom Parts =

"""Hide and disable unselected parts of a groom for faster feedback."""

This tool allows you to hide [Hair Generate|Node:/obj/hairgen] objects that don't operate on the same region as selected [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] nodes. It also fills in the __Isolate Groom Objects__ parameter in any [Groom Merge|Node:obj/groommerge] that references the selected nodes, causing these to ignore any other nodes. Running the tool with all relevant [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] selected clears the parameter.

This tool is useful for speeding up cooking and for getting a clear view of the area you're currently working on.

For more information, see the [Fur Workflow|/fur/workflow] help.

== Using Isolate Groom Parts == (includeme)

    # Select the [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] you want to work on.

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/isolate_parts]__Isolate Groom Parts__ tool on the __Hair Utils__ tab. This will hide the [Hair Generate|Node:/obj/hairgen] objects that don't use the selected guides.

    This example shows fur being generated on the head, but not the torso, since only the head was selected before using this tool.
    
    TIP:
        If you select another [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] section to work on and use this tool, it will hide the previous one and only display the newly selected one.
