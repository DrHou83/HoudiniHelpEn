= Paint Muscle Mask =

"""Paints a mask attribute on the skin geometry per muscle_id to limit the effects of a Muscle Deform to specific regions."""

This tool paints a mask attribute on the skin geometry per `muscle_id` to limit the effects of a [Muscle Displace|/shelf/muscle_displace] to specific regions. This tool is useful where muscles may overlap and cause unwanted displacement on the skin.  For example, if you have leg muscles that overlap abdominal muscles on a creature, and the effect of the abdominal muscle displacement needs to be subdued, you can paint a region mask on the skin that limits the displacement to only the leg muscles.

== Using Paint Muscle Mask == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/paint_muscle_mask][Paint Muscle Mask|Node:sop/capturelayerpaint] tool on the __Muscles__ shelf tab.
    
    # Select the skin object that has a [Muscle Displace|/shelf/muscle_displace] applied to it.

    # If your skin object has not been previously painted with this tool, you will be prompted to select muscles to capture with.  This step simply ensures that your skin attributes are prepared to receive the painted weighting for your `muscle_id`'s.

    # Once your capture attributes have been applied, you will be able to paint on your skin geometry.  

    # From the dropdown menu in the operation toolbar, select the __Capture Region__ you wish to paint with. These capture regions will be initialized with the `muscle_id` attributes found on the muscle geometry.  By painting on the surface, you are assigning a weight value for that particular region.  Only the muscles and centers that match the id attribute on the painted surface will have any effect on the displacement of those surface points.

    TIP:
	    Individual rigged muscles and franken muscles can share common `muscle_id` attributes.  See the __Muscle ID__ parameter on [Muscle|Node:obj/riggedmuscle] asset.  This will group the displacement contribution for all associated muscles and limit or "mask" the displacement in painted regions.
