= Heat Within Object =

"""Turns an object into a source of heating when particles pass through."""

This tool will take an object and turn it into a source of heating when particles pass through. You would typically use this tool if you want to heat a fluid in your scene that has been set up with another one of the tools on the Viscous Fluid shelf. For example, simulating a cool object being put onto a heated grill, causing it to melt. Another use would be for artistically controlling part of your viscous fluid. For example, if you were simulating a river of lava which cools over time and comes to a stop, you could place hot objects along the river to prevent it from cooling down too much.


== Using Heat within Object ==

# Select the object to be the heat source.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/heat_within_object]__Heat Within Object__ tool on the Viscous Fluids tab. 

# Select the fluid object to heat, and press ((Enter)).
