= Paint Bend =

"""Interactively changes the bend of fur by painting your geometry."""

This tool is useful for interactively modifying the bend of fur. It allows
you to manually paint the bend of fur on the skin geometry.

After adding fur with the [Icon:FUR/add_fur][Add Fur|addfur] tool, use the
[Icon:FUR/comb][Comb Fur|combfur] tool and some of the paint tools to style
the fur.  Finally, use the [Icon:FUR/add_dynamics][Add Dynamics|furdynamics]
tool to make the fur react to the character's motion and external forces.

This tool works independently of the [Paint Fur Bend Noise|/shelf/paintfurbendnoise] tool. The amount of bending is basically the sum of the comb and bend values. 

TIP:
    You should use the comb tool before using the bend tools, because they depend on the combed direction. Both influence how much a hair arcs towards the combed direction.
    
== Using Paint Bend == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/orientation][Paint Bend|paintfurbend] tool on the __Fur__ tab.

    # Select the fur object to paint and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
    
        NOTE:
            Modify the __FG__ multiplier field to increase or decrease the amount of fur bend to paint. A value of 0 will remove fur, 1 will not change the bend of fur, and anything larger than 1 will increase the bend of the fur.

    # Drag the [brush|/basics/brush] over the surface to paint it.
    
        NOTE:
            You can change the __Radius__ of your brush by holding ((Shift + LMB)) and dragging or by changing the value in the Operation Controls toolbar. You can also alter the __Opacity__ in the Operation Controls toolbar.

For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/paint][Paint|Node:sop/paint] node help.

NOTE:
    The parameters on this tool are associated with the parameters on the __Physical__ > __Bend__ tab of the [Fur Object|Node:obj/fur]. The bend parameters on this tab scale the effect of the Paint Bend tool. 

== Tips ==

Houdini will recook each time a brush stroke is made. To improve responsiveness while painting, reduce the __Display Density__ on the __Basic__ tab of the [Icon:SOP/fur][Fur Object|Node:obj/fur]. If this does not speed up Houdini enough, you can turn off the __Display__ checkbox which will disable the display of hairs for improved responsiveness while you paint the geometry. 

If you simply want to turn off the display of hairs for a moment when painting, you can hide other objects in the viewport by clicking [Icon:VIEW/show_all] in the viewer toolbar and selecting __Hide Other Objects__. This has the same effect on performance as turning off the __Display__ checkbox on the fur object. Once you are done painting you can click [Icon:VIEW/show_all] and choose __Show All Objects__ to display the fur again.

Once you paint the fur bend, you may want to use some of the other paint tools to style the fur, such as: [Paint Density|/shelf/paintfurdensity], [Paint Clumping|/shelf/paintfurclumping], [Paint Base Color|/shelf/paintbasecolor], [Paint Frizz|/shelf/paintfurfrizz], [Paint White Hair Density|/shelf/paintwhitehairdensity], [Paint Guard Hair Density|/shelf/paintguardhairdensity], or [Paint Guard Hair Length|/shelf/paintguardhairlength].

You may also want to use the [Icon:FUR/add_dynamics][Add Dynamics|furdynamics]
tool to make the fur react to the character's motion and external forces.
