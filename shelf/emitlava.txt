= Emit Lava =

"""Generates a continuous stream of hot lava from an object."""

This tool will set up a simulation to generate a continuous stream of hot lava from an object. It also applies a lava shader to the result of the simulation. You would typically use this tool to simulate something like a volcanic eruption, or to create a pouring stream of hot lava.

NOTE:
    This tool uses a SOP attribute to control the initial temperature of the emitter instead of the __Temperature__ parameter on the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject]. 


== Using Emit Lava ==

# Create a geometry object to be converted into lava.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/volcano]__Emit Lava__ tool on the Viscous Fluids tab. 

# Select a fluid object to emit lava into, if any, and press ((Enter)).

    For specific parameter information, see the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject] and [Gas Temperature Update|Node:dop/gastemperatureupdate] help pages.

== Tips ==

- Turning on the __Enable Temperature Diffusion__ checkbox on the [Gas Temperature Update DOP|Node:dop/gastemperatureupdate] will give you parameters that will allow heat form the hot part of the lava to cause cooler parts of the lava to heat up and melt. 

    The __Radius__ parameter will control how wide the blur radius is for the temperature field.
    
    The __Heat/Cold Bias__ will control how much the current temperature is affected by the hotter/cooler temperatures around it.


- The __Solidify Threshold__ parameter on the [Gas Temperature Update DOP|Node:dop/gastemperatureupdate] controls the point at which the lava will solidify. This is meant to simulate how lava will go from a fluid to developing a crust and essentially becoming a rock very quickly.  The higher this value is, the earlier this state change will occur.
