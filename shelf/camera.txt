== Placing cameras in the viewer ==   (includeme)
    
    There are three ways you can place cameras in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. They can be moved once they are placed by either dragging them in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] or changing the values in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
    
    :task:Place cameras in a specific location in the scene view:
    
        # Click the desired [camera|Node:obj/cam] from the __Lights and Cameras__ tab.
            
        # Move the cursor into the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
            
            You can hold ((Alt)) to detach the shape from the construction plane.
                
        # Click ((LMB)) to place the camera anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. 
    
    :task:Place cameras at the origin:
    
        # Click the desired [camera|Node:OBJ/cam] from the __Lights and Cameras__ tab.
            
        # Move your cursor into the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] and press ((Enter)) to place the shape at the origin.
    
    :task:Place a camera by looking through it:
    
        # ((Ctrl)) click the desired [camera|Node:OBJ/cam] from the __Lights and Cameras__ tab.
            
        # Use the handles or edit the values in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] to move the [camera|Node:OBJ/cam] to the desired location in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
            
        When looking through the camera there are handles on the sides of the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] which allows you to orient and crop.

    === Handles ===
    
    Clicking ((RMB)) on cameras in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] gives you more [camera and light manipulator handle options|/basics/handles_camlights]. The two that are unique to cameras are the focus handle and the frustum handle.
           
    Frustum handle:
        Allows you to set the near and far clipping planes and the focal length.
        
    Focus handle:
        Allows you to control the depth map focus.
        
    === Use the view keys to move a camera ===
    
    # Look through a [camera|Node:OBJ/cam] as described above. You can also choose a camera to look through once it is created by choosing it in the [camera menu|/basics/view].

    # Lock the [camera|Node:OBJ/cam] to the view by clicking the [Icon:VIEW/display_lock_camera] Lock camera/light to the view button, which is located on the toolbar on the right side of the view. You can also lock the camera to view by by turning on __Tie Camera (or Light) to View__ in the camera menu.
    
    # Use the [tumble, track, and dolly|/basics/view] keys to move the [camera|Node:OBJ/cam].
    
    # Unlock the camera to place it.
    
    === Make a camera look at an object ===
    
    # Create an object.
    
    # Create a [camera|Node:OBJ/cam].
    
    # Click __Look At__ on the [Modify shelf|/shelf/modify].
    
    # Select the object to look at and press ((Enter)).
    
    You can also make a camera look at an object by setting it on the __Lookat Options__ tab on the __Transform tab__ of the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
