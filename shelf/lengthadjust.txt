= Length Adjust =

"""Lets you interactively vary the length of the ends of the hair."""

This tool allows you to interactively vary the length of the ends of the hair, to give it a more natural look. This is typically used after the [Cut Hair|/shelf/cuthair] tool to soften the harshness of the cut and add randomization to the tips. This tool works by shrinking the hair along its path, keeping the original shape.


== Using Length Adjust  == (includeme)

    # Click the [Icon:FUR/adjust_length][Length Adjust|Node:obj/guidegroom] tool on the __Grooming__ tab.

    # Hold ((LMB)) and drag across the ends of the hair to add randomization of the length.

    TIP:
        Scrolling the mouse wheel or holding ((Shift)) while dragging ((LMB)) will let you resize your brush.

    For specific parameter information, see the [Guide Groom|Node:obj/guidegroom] help.
