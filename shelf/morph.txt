    # Create an object in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].
    
    # Make sure that your object is selected and click the [Icon:SOP/blendshapes][Morph|Node:sop/blendshapes] tool on the __Deform__ tab.
    
    # Select the points you want to manipulate and [transform, rotate, and scale|/basics/handles] as desired.
        The [Morph|Node:sop/blendshapes] tool automatically creates an [Icon:SOP/edit][Edit|Node:sop/edit] node and a [Icon:SOP/blendshapes][Blend Shapes|Node:sop/blendshapes] node at the geometry (SOP) level for the geometry you edit.
    
    # Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/unpinned]pin button on the __Scene View__ tab and go to the geometry level of your object.
    
    # Make the second set of changes to your object.
    
    # Modify the __Weight__ sliders to control the blending of the edits for each input in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
