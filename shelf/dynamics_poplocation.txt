        :task:Place Emitter anywhere in the scene:
                # Click the [Icon:POP/location] [Location|Node:dop/poplocation] tool on the __Particles__ tab.
            
                # Move the cursor into the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview]. You can hold ((Shift)) to move off the construction plane.
            
                # Click to place the [Icon:SOP/particle][particle system|/dopparticles] anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.
            
                If you press ((Enter)) without clicking, Houdini places the emitter at the origin.
                
                # Click [Icon:PLAYBAR/play_forward] [play|/anim/playbar] to see the particles.
