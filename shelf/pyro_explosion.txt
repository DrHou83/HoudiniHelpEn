"""Creates a large explosion rising from the selected object."""

This tool creates a pyro simulation similar to the [fireball|pyro_fireball] but keeps igniting after the initial explosion and is a bit more chaotic (more shredding, less diffusion, more confinement).
See the help for the [fireball tool|pyro_fireball] for more information.

See [how to use the pyro tools|/pyro/pyro].
