= Lava from Object =

"""Creates a lava object from geometry."""

This tool turns a geometry object into a particle fluid with defaults appropriate for simulating lava. It also applies a lava shader to the result of the simulation. You would typically use this tool if you want an object made from lava which will cool off and harden over time.

NOTE:
    The difference between this tool and [Melt Object|/shelf/meltobject] is that this tool assigns a shader to get a basic glowing lava look, while [Melt Object|/shelf/meltobject] doesn't apply any shader. 


== Using Lava from Object ==

# Create a geometry object to be converted into lava.

# Click the [Icon:SHELF/convert_to_lava]__Lava from Object__ tool on the Viscous Fluids tab. 

    For specific parameter information, see the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject] and [Gas Temperature Update|Node:dop/gastemperatureupdate] help pages.
