The tools on this shelf are different from the tools on the Fur tab, since they work with guides, not skin. The main advantage in using these tools is for creating long hair or fur, since you can easily create the desired shape using curves.

The tools on the [Hair shelf|/shelf/hair] paint attributes on the skin that are then used by the fur tools to create/modify the fur in a fully procedural way, while the tools on the Grooming shelf use actual stroking tools to create hair and style it artistically.
