= Edit Capture Blends =

"""Allows you to adjust the blending of previously captured geometry in the Object Viewer."""

To use this tool you must have previously [Icon:SOP/capture][captured geometry|capturegeometry]. It allows you to go back and retouch the capture blends to smooth the blended regions and ensure there are no gaps.

== Using Edit Capture Blends ==

# Select one or more captured objects.

# Click the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/editcaptureblend] Edit Capture Blends tool on the __Characters__ tab.

# Use the slider(s) in the lower-left corner of the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview] to adjust the blending of your capture weights.

<!--

The Edit Capture Blends operation allows you to adjust the blending of
previously captured geometry in the Object Viewer.

After selecting your geometry objects and right-clicking, you are
presented with on-screen sliders for all the Capture and
CaptureProximity SOPs embedded in the selected objects. These sliders
allow you to adjust their blend factor. For CaptureProximity SOPs, Drop
Off sliders are also available for adjustment.

Geometry may be captured multiple times by different bones to adjust
their weights. To do this, use the Capture Geometry operation to add
more bones to capture. See the help on the Capture Geometry operation
for more details.
