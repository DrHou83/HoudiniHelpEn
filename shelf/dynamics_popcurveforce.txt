= Curve Force =

"""Creates forces generated from a curve."""

This tool uses the [POP Curve Force|Node:dop/popcurveforce] node to apply a force to particles to steer them along, toward, or around a curve.

== Using Curve Force == (includeme)

        # Create a curve using the [Icon:SOP/drawcurve][Draw Curve|/shelf/drawcurve] shelf tool.
        
        # Create a particle system along the curve using the [Icon:POP/location][Location|/shelf/dynamics_poplocation] or [Icon:POP/source][Source|/shelf/dynamics_popsource] shelf tools.
        
        # Click the [Icon:DOP/vortexforce][Curve Force|Node:dop/popcurveforce] tool on the __Particles__ tab.
        
        # Select the curve you want to affect your [particles|/dopparticles] and press ((Enter)).

        TIP:
                The particle system should be inside the diameter of the force tube.
