= Bones from Curve =

"""Allows you to create a bone chain along a curve."""

This tool is useful for creating a character's spine or tail, as it evenly spaces bones on a curve. It could also be used to form the skeleton of a snake.

== Using Bones == (includeme)
    
    # In the viewport, press ((Tab)) and type [Path|Node:obj/path].

    # Draw the curve in the viewport.
    
    # Make sure the curve is selected, and click the [Icon:OBJ_STATE/bonesfromcurve]Bones from Curve tool on the __Characters__ tab.
    
        You can change the __Kinematics__ to Follow Curve in the drop-down menu on the operations toolbar if you want the bones to be bound to the [curve|/shelf/curve]. This allows you to modify the curve and the bone chain is automatically adjusted.
    
    # Name the chain of bones in the __Chain Name__ field on the operations toolbar.
        You can also increase or decrease the __Number of Bones__ in the chain by changing the value in the value in the operations toolbar.

<!--
he Bones From Curve operation allows you to create a bone chain along a
curve.

After selecting your curve and right-clicking, a specified number of
bones is created with joints placed on the curve. The first and the last
joints coincide with the curve ends.

SETTING A KINEMATICS SOLVER

When a bone chain is created, a currently selected solver is assigned to
the chain. The solver can be changed (by selecting a new solver type)
after the bones have been created. Note, that when re-entering the Bones
from Curve tool state, no bone chain is affected by changing solver
type, even if that chain has been created using this tool.

SOLVER TYPES

No Kinematics: once the bones are created they are not affected by the
curve.

Follow Curve: the bones will allign and orient themselves to the curve.
If the bone chain is too short, not all of the curve will be used by the
bones. If the bone chain is too long, the bones will follow the tangent
line at the end of the curve.

Spine: the bones will allign and orient themselves to the curve. The end
of the bone chain will be the same as the curve end. To achieve this,
the bones will not necessarily lie on the curve, but they will try to
preserve an overall shape of the curve.
