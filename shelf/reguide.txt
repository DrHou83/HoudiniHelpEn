= Reguide =

"""Interpolates guides between planted guides."""

This tool is typically used after the [Plant Guides|/shelf/plantguides] tool, as it interpolates guides between the ones you already have. If you put down a handful of guides and groom them, you can use this tool to quickly and easily fill in the rest. This is useful to quickly get a rough shape for the fur on your character. It is also typically used for fur, or characters that are completely covered in hair.
