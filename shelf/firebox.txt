= Flamefront Container =

"""Creates a container that can hold a flamefront."""

Once the fuel burns it will produce smoke and soot. It can be used, for example, to hold and simulate a candle.

== Using Flamefront Container ==

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/box_fire]Flamefront Container tool on the __Volume Fluids__ tab.
    
    # Place the container anywhere in the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview].

:task:Create fire in the container:
    
    # Place a geometry object inside the container.
    
    # Use the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_source][Source from volume|sourcefromvolume] tool to turn the geometry object into a fire object.
        
    # On the object DOP, increase the __Temperature__ on the __Physical__ tab. 
        
        By default the temperature is set to 0. The fuel will not ignite if the temperature is not hot enough.
            
        You can also increase the temperature of a nearby fire object, which will ignite the source object.
    
:task:Change the amount of divisions in the container:
    
    Edit the __Divisions__ on the operation controls toolbar or in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].
        
    Reducing the divisions will make your simulation faster and increasing the divisions will make your simulations more detailed.
        
:task:Let the smoke escape the boundaries of the container:
    
    Turn off the __Closed Boundaries__ checkbox on the operation controls toolbar or in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms].

NOTE:
    The large tick marks indicate 10 divisions. So, the flamefront container in this example has 20 divisions.

A possible next step could be to eliminate some smoke and soot. To remove smoke and soot from a simulation, use the [Icon:SHELF/fluid_sink][Sink from Objects|sinkfromobjects] tool on the Fluids shelf.

You may also want to add some turbulence to your smoke and soot. You can do this by applying [Icon:SHELF/seedvorticles][Seed Vorticles|seedvorticles].
