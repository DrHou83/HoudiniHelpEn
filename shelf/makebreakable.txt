"""Automatically fractures an RBD object."""

This tool creates a [Voronoi Fracture Configure Object|Node:dop/voronoifractureconfigureobject] from an [RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] or an [RBD Packed Object|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject], which causes the object to break realistically on impact.  It also creates new objects
for any pieces created by fracturing these objects. This is useful for background objects in a scene, since it is a fast and realistic way of breaking an object without having to do anything before hand. If you want more artistic control of the break, you can use the [Break|/shelf/break] or [Shatter|/shelf/shatter] tools on the __Model__ tab of the shelf. These tools let you prebreak geometry, which you can then make into an [RBD Glue Object|/shelf/rbdglueobject].

== Using Make Breakable == (includeme)

    # Select the object you want to break, and click the [Icon:DOP/rbdobject][RBD Object|Node:dop/rbdobject] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

        NOTE:
            Once you convert geometry to an RBD object you can only [transform, rotate, and scale|/basics/handles#basic-handles] it when it is on the first frame.

    # Make sure the new object is selected and click the [Icon:SHELF/makebreakable][Make Breakable|Node:dop/voronoifractureconfigureobject] tool on the __Rigid Bodies__ tab.

    For specific parameter help see the [Icon:SOP/assemble][Voronoi Fracture
    Configure Object|Node:dop/voronoifractureconfigureobject] dynamics node help.
