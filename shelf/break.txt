= Break =

"""Breaks the input geometry using the specified cutting shape."""

This tool cuts a model along a jagged cutting plane. The cutting plane can also be switched to a box, sphere, or custom object. You can then use the pieces with the [RBD Fractured Object|Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject] or [RBD Glue Object|Node:dop/rbdglueobject]. This will automatically clean up the faces, and unique the points so you don't see the cracks.

[RBD Fractured Object|Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject] and [RBD Glue Object|Node:dop/rbdglueobject] automatically add an [Assemble|Node:sop/assemble] node after any breaks, which creates groups for each piece of broken geometry.

The Break tool creates a single jagged cut with manual control, whereas [Shatter|/shelf/shatter] creates multiple random cuts automatically.

NOTE:
    This tool only works on polygons.

== Using Break == (includeme)

# Select the object you want to break.

# Click the [Icon:SOP/break][Break|Node:sop/break] tool on the __Model__ tab.

    You can do this multiple times to create multiple breaks in a single geometry object.

NOTE:
    By default, the Break tool will select connected primitives. If you want to select individual faces, right-click the [Icon:TOOLS/select_faces] component mode button on the left toolbar and turn off __Select Connected Geometry__.

You can then turn your object into an [RBD Fracture Object|Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject] or an [RBD Glue Object|Node:dop/rbdglueobject].    

TIP:
    If you want to simulate pieces breaking off of something else, for example rocks breaking off a cliff, you can use the [extract|/shelf/extract] tool to separate the static objects from dynamic objects.

If you do not want to use this tool with dynamics, you will need to append an [Assemble SOP|Node:sop/assemble]. Turning the object into an RBD Fracture Object or an RBD Glue Object will create the Assemble node for you.
