= Beach Tank =

"""Creates a FLIP fluid simulation of a beach with continuous waves."""

This tool creates a FLIP tank simulation of waves breaking on a beach or other shallow water terrain.  This tool is similar to the [Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank], except it enables an option to ramp down ocean velocities in a certain direction across the length of the tank.  Reducing the velocities allow the ocean waves to break naturally as the water get shallower.  The FLIP Simulation uses a [POP Advect By Volumes|Node:dop/popadvectbyvolumes] node to continuously add the ramped wave velocities to the simulation.

Similar to the [Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank], this tool creates a _boundary layer_ of particles to suppress reflections at the edge of the tank, contribute ocean velocities back to the simulation, and maintain the water volume level to match the ocean.  The boundary layer will by default be disabled along the maximum extent of the volume in the specified direction.

The [Ocean Spectrum|Node:sop/oceanspectrum] node allows you to shape the initial frame of your simulated ocean, and [Ocean Source|Node:sop/oceansource] controls the outputs. 

TIP:
    For more information, see the [differences between ocean tank types|/shelf/ocean_differences] help page.

== Using Beach Tank ==
    
# Click the [Icon:SHELF/beach_tank] __Beach Tank__ tool on the __Oceans__ tab to create a tank.

# Select a polygonal object to be extruded and act as the main beach collision object. If you don't choose an object, a default one will be created for you.
