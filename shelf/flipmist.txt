= Mist =

"""Emits mist particles into a smoke simulation one-way based on an underlying FLIP fluid simulation."""

This tool uses a [Gas Mist Solver|Node:dop/gasmistsolver] that creates a fine spray from a FLIP simulation. It is finer than [Whitewater|/shelf/whitewater] and behaves like smoke as the particles (vaporized water) get pushed around by the air. This is useful in simulations where water is falling from high up. For example, creating a plume of mist from a waterfall.

== Using Mist == 
    
# Click the [Icon:SHELF/flipmist] Mist tool on the __Particle Fluids__ tab.
    
# Select the Fluid from which to generate mist and press ((Enter)) to confirm your selection.

NOTE:
        You may need to navigate into the DOP Network containing the fluid object to select it.
