= UV Transform =

"""Transforms UV texture coordinates on the source geometry."""

Make sure the object has UVs and a [Icon:SHOP/vopmaterial][Material|/shade/] assigned to it. 

You also need to have a texture projected onto a [model|/model/] in order to use the UV Transform tool.

This tool works the same way as [Icon:SOP/uvedit][UV Edit|Node:sop/uvedit]; however, it only allows you to edit one set of points at a time. Each time you want to perform a different edit you must put down another UV Transform node. This is useful if you want to keep track of your edit history and make it easy to return and change specific transformations later on. Also, unlike the [UV Edit|Node:sop/uvedit] operation, UV Transform supports [animation|/anim/] of UVs.

== Using UV Transform == (includeme)
    
    # Click the [Icon:SOP/uvtransform][UV Transform|Node:sop/uvtransform] tool on the __Texture__ tab.
    
        NOTE:
            You can load the texture image as the background in your UV viewport to easily view edit changes.
    
    # Drag the vertices using the UV Transform handles.
