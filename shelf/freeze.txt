"""Moves object level transforms into a Transform SOP at the geometry level."""

This tool is useful in Modeling if you accidentally scale your object, since it gives you the ability to model without scales. 

However, this tool should not be used for rigging. To clear the transforms, go to the __Pre-Transform__ dropdown menu and choose to clean the Translates, Rotates, or Scales. See [Pre-Transforms|/basics/objects#pretransform] for more information.

== Using Freeze ==
        
    # Select the object whose transforms you wish to be moved to a [Transform SOP|Node:sop/xform]. 
    
        NOTE:
            You can hold ((Shift)) to select multiple objects.

    # Click the [Icon:SHELF/freezetransforms] Freeze tool on the __Modify__ tab.
    
    At the object level, the __Translate__ and __Rotate__ parameters will be reverted to 0, and the __Scale__ parameters will be reverted to 1. At the geometry level, a new [Transform SOP|Node:sop/xform] will be added and the __Translate__, __Rotate__, and __Scale__ parameters will have the values of the original transforms at the object level.

    TIP:
        If you only want to freeze certain parameters, you can lock the ones you don't want to move by clicking ((RMB)) the parameter and selecting __Lock Parameter__.
