= What was new in |> Dynamics =


== Pyro ==

:improved:
    Fully OpenCL-accelerated [pyro pipeline|/pyro].


== RBD ==

:new:
    New __Sleeping Time__ parameter on the [Bullet solver|Node:dop/bulletrbdsolver] controls how long objects must be below their linear and angular speed thresholds before being put to sleep.

:new:
    New parameters on the [RBD Packed Object DOP|Node:dop/rbdpackedobject] to use the DOP network's input geometry and to specify alternate display geometry.

:new:
    New point attributes (`accelmax` and `angaccelmax`) can be used to limit the change in velocity from enforcing constraints and collisions.

:improved:
    Bullet RBD objects collide with the new [height field|terrain] primitives.
    
:improved:
    Improved multithreading. For simulations with many separate groups of active objects connected by constraints and/or contacts, the default constraint solver can now solve the constraint groups in parallel.

:improved:
    When inherit velocity is enabled for animated static objects, the velocity is now transferred when the object becomes active instead of on its first simulation frame.
    The velocity transfer also now only involves the `v` and `w` attributes on the packed primitive's point - the solver no longer unpacks the geometry to check for additional velocity attributes.

:improved:
    Improved support for deforming active objects.

:changed:
    The ODE Solver has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Houdini. The Bullet solver should be used instead.


== General ==

:improved:
    Built-in Intel OpenCL driver with CPU fallback for simulation on the farm.
