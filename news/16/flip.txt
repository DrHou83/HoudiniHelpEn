:new:
    :fig:[Image:/images/dynamics/suction_force_skull.jpg]
        [Suction force|/shelf/suctionfluid]: art-directed fluids driven by animated geometry.

:new:
    [Waterline|Node:dop/flipsolver] open boundary option on FLIP tanks prevents splashes up the sides of the tank.

:new:
    [Guided simulation|/shelf/guidedoceanlayer]: drive a hi-res FLIP ocean simulation from an ocean spectrum.

:new:
    :fig:[Image:/images/nodes/sop/heightfield_dop_interaction.jpg]
        Native support for collision with [height field terrains|terrain].

:improved:
    Physically correct simulation of surface tension. The included [Drip|/shelf/dripparticlefluid] and [Crown splash|/shelf/crownsplash] shelf tools demonstrate the effects.

:improved:
    Enhanced [viscosity solving|Node:dop/flipsolver]. Slip controls let you define areas that are more or less slippery, so for example you can have mud slide off a character's eyes faster than the rest of the face.

:improved:
    Improved collision resolution.
