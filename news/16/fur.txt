:new:
    Complete overhaul of [hair and fur creation, grooming and rendering|/fur/] to produce a fast, versatile, interactive and procedural system.
    
    * Open, SOP-based approach to grooming (no black boxes).
    
    * Unrestricted layering of grooming operations in SOPs.
    
    * Rich set of dedicated tools, such as clump, frizz, curl, trim, extend and part.
    
    * Flexible masking tools to isolate areas of interest.
    
    * Ability to override any attribute via texture maps or 3D paint.
    
    * Total freedom to mix 2D (surface attribute painting) and 3D (guide hair shape) grooming.
    
    * Equal editing access to grooming guides and generated hair.

:new:
    High-quality hair visualisation in the viewport.

:new:
    Render-time evaluation of grooming SOP network in mantra replaces "fur procedural", without using an extra license. The hair interpolation preview in Houdini and render-time hair interpolation use the same (open) SOP network.

:new:
    Hair and Fur desktop with specialized shelf tools and radial menus.

:new:
    [Initialize Guides|/shelf/sop_groom_guideinit] shelf tool runs a wind simulation to set up natural initial guide orientations.    

:new:
    Parameters for grooming attributes have a "paint" button that lets you paint the attribute in the viewport.

:new:
    New hair material.

:improved:
    Much better hair rendering in the viewer.

:improved:
    Greatly improved hair performance. The new hair/fur tools take advantage of compiled SOPs, OpenCL, and advanced OpenGL features.
