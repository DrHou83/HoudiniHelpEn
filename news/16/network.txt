= What was new in |> the Network Editor =


:new:
    *The [network editor|/network/] is completely rewritten in Houdini 16*, adding discoverability, ease of use, and conveniences, and fixing long-standing problems.

    * Brand new architecture for better performance, user experience, and future extensibility.

    * Completely redesigned look and feel.


== Nodes ==

:new:
    The [node ring|/network/nodes#ring] lets you access the info window and node flags from a hover menu around the node. It makes the info window and flags more visible to new users, and makes it easier to set flags when you are zoomed far out.

:new:
    The network editor now shows [badges|/network/flags#badges] below the node name to indicate various node statuses, for example "warning" and "time dependent". You can use the network editor [display options|/network/options] to choose to hide a badge type, or make a badge type large to make them more visible.

:new:
    You can show a [node's comment|/network/organize#comments] next to the node in the network editor. This can be useful to explain a node's purpose beyond its name, especially in example or demo files.

:new:
    You can now create a quick copy of a node by ((Alt))-dragging the node to drag out a copy.

:new:
    The node type is displayed above the node name (when it's not obvious from the name). You can turn this off in the options.

:improved:
    The [info window|/network/nodes#info] is accessible as a transient window by pressing ((MMB)) on a node, or as a persistent floating window from the info button in the node ring. The info window contents are now laid out in a cleaner and more readable form.

    The info window now includes interactive elements such as an editable comment field. Node paths are clickable links.


== Navigation ==

:new:
    [Quickmark hotkeys|/network/navigate#quick] to jump between networks or within one network.

:improved:
    Powerful [node search engine|/network/find].

:improved:
    You can now hold ((Space)) and drag ((LMB)) or ((RMB)) in the network editor to pan and zoom.


== Layout ==

:new:
    When you place a node, existing nodes now automatically move out of the way to preserve spacing.

:new:
    Snapping guides for fast and easy node alignment.

:new:
    Gesture-driven [layout tools|/network/layout].


== Wiring ==

:new:
    You can now [route wires with dots|/network/wire#dots].

:new:
    Alt-click a node to get a wiring menu. This is useful when you're zoomed out so far the connectors are tiny or invisible.

:new:
    Easier, more intuitive [wiring|/network/wire].

:new:
    Hold ((Y)) and drag across wires to disconnect them.

:new:
    Dimming of long wires to prevent obstruction of nodes.

:improved:
    You can now drag between connectors as an alternative to click-clicking.

:improved:
    You can multi-select wires. Selecting multiple wires and connecting one connects all selected wires.

:improved:
    You can drag existing wires to different connectors.

:improved:
    Wires and dots are selectable, draggable, and have their own context menus. This means you can do things like select a bunch of wires and drag them or press ((Del)) to remove them. You can right click a wire and choose "Disconnect". You can use a dot's context menu to pull out one of the wires going through it.


== Organizing and annotating networks ==

:new:
    You can add [floating background images|/network/organize#images] to networks. You can tether an image to a node so it moves with the node.

:new:
    :fig:[Image:/images/nodes/node_shapes.png]
        [Custom node shapes|/network/organize#custom].

:improved:
    [Network box|/network/organize#netbox] interaction is now more intuitive.

    Dragging a node over a netbox highlights the box to show the node will go in the box if you drop it.

    Dragging a node toward the edge of a netbox will expand the box. Dragging out faster removes the node from the box.
    
    Double-click the title bar of a netbox to give it a human readable title. (This is not the internal name of the netbox. The title can include spaces.) You can use this to label the contents for when the box is minimized.
    
    You can now automatically resize a netbox to its fit its contents using __Layout > Resize network boxes to fit__.

:improved:
    Font size, color and background controls for [sticky notes|/network/organize#notes].


== UI ==

:new:
    Resizable [palettes|/network/organize#custom] and [overview|/network/navigate#overview].

:improved:
    The NNE now has menus to surface functionality that were previously invisible to new users, such as showing and hiding palettes, the tab menu, the tree view, and so on.

:improved:
    Visual indication of [dependencies|/network/dependencies], with handy jump menus.

:bug:
    The network editor has a dark color scheme even if you choose the "Light" or "Pro" color schemes in Houdini.


== Changes ==

:changed:
    Netboxes and stickies no longer show their internal names in the network editor. Instead, netboxes have an editable title. You can get the internal names through scripting.

:changed:
    Some hotkeys for seldom-used functions have been removed (especially single-key hotkeys). The functions are now usable from the [pane menus|/network/menus].

:changed:
    Some network editor hotkeys have changed:

    * The number keys ((1)), ((2)), ((3)), ((4)), and ((5)) are now used for [quickmarks|/network/navigate#quick]. See [node flags|/network/flags] for the new flag hotkeys in different network types.

    * The ((=)) key is now the only hotkey to add a file node. The ((`)) key now returns you to the previous network/view, for use with [quickmarks|/network/navigate#quick].

    * The hotkey to add a sticky note was changed from ((Ctrl + P)) to ((Shift + P)).
