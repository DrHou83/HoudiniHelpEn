        Waves can be applied artifact-free even to deformed/warped base grids.

:new:
    Art-directed, animated hero waves can be mixed in seamlessly.

:new:
    Masking tools to isolate areas of interest.

:new:

        [Guided simulation|/shelf/guidedoceanlayer]: seamless blending of FLIP fluid sim with ocean surface.

:improved:
    Improved boundary layer that preserves boundary velocities

:improved:
    Very fast, OpenCL accelerated.

:changed:
    The [Guided Ocean Layer|/shelf/guidedoceanlayer] shelf tool replaces the Splash Tank and Wave Layer Tanks tools. The Guided Ocean Layer tool creates higher-quality output than the old tools.
