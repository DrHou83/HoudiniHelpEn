= What was new in |> Terrain generation =

:new:
    New architecture for terrain generation through [2D height field volumes|/model/heightfields], with new SOP nodes and support in the viewer and mantra renderer.
    
    * Procedural terrain generation.
    
    * 30+ dedicated nodes.
    
    * Straightforward worflow, similar to image compositing but in 3D.
    
    * Masks limit operations to certain areas.
    
    * Viewport visualization of 2D height fields as 3D surfaces, and masks as surface tinting.
    
    * Dedicated Mantra procedural for rendering.
    
    * Very fast: hardware accelerated via OpenCL.

:new:
    Mask inputs to limit effects to certain areas. Generate masks from free-form curves, texture maps, or the output of other height field nodes.

:new:
    Import height field data from standard GeoTIFF and several Lidar formats.

:new:
    Project 3D models into the height field, or paint height free-form.

        Powerful erosion models.

:new:
    Output height fields as polygonal surfaces, 3D volumes, or image maps.

:new:
    Works with existing Houdini tools:
    
    * Because height fields and masks are standard Houdini volumes, you can use existing tools such as volume SOPs and Wrangles to edit them.

    * You can import height fields into COPs and use compositing nodes to edit them.

:new:
    Examples in the __Terrain FX__ shelf tab.

:new:
    Native output to game engines.

:new:
    Fully tile-able, game-friendly terrain material and specialized shader for VFX use.

        Native integration with dynamics and crowds.


== Nodes ==

The new SOPs have names starting with *HeightField*.

TIP:
    In the ((Tab)) menu, you can abbreviates prefixes and initials in node names. So you can type "`height`" or just "`hf`" instead of typing "`height field`".
    
    For example, you can type "`hf mbo`" to select [Height Field Mask by Object|Node:sop/heightfield_maskbyobject].
