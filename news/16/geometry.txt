= What was new in |> Geometry and modeling =



== Interface ==

[Include:general#radialmenus]

:new:
    [Interior snapping|/model/aids].

[Include:general#infinitegrid]

:improved:
    Improved the preservation of selections to work more like you'd expect.

:improved:
    "Sloppy" component selection in the [Edit SOP|Node:sop/edit] is now an option you can turn off.

[Include:general#spacemouse]


== Modeling tools ==

:new:
    :fig:[Image:/images/nodes/sop/boolean_shatter_dragon.jpg]
        Fast [Boolean node|Node:sop/boolean] with exact predicates and arithmetic, capable of boolean operations and free-form shattering.

:new:
    :fig:[Image:/images/nodes/sop/polyfill_sphere_patch.jpg]
        [PolyFill SOP|Node:sop/polyfill] replaces the deprecated PolyCap. Intelligently fills holes in polygonal models with triangles or quads. Together with [TopoBuild|Node:sop/topobuild] it replaces PolyKnit as well.

:new:
    [Attribute Expression SOP|Node:sop/attribexpression] replaces the Point SOP. You must now enter VEX expressions to modify attributes instead of Hscript expressions.

:new:
    [Attribute Blur SOP|Node:sop/attribblur] smooths float attribute values. Takes advantage of OpenCL so is very fast on computers with dedicated graphics hardware. Supports uniform and edge weighted blur. Full control over blurring iterations. Can control blur amount with an attribute. Mesh blur mode blurs based on connectivity, point cloud blur mode blurs based on proximity.

:new:
    [Compiled SOPs|/model/compile] allow parallel cooking and memory savings, and lay the foundation for future improvements.

:new:
    [OpenCL SOP|Node:sop/opencl] lets you run OpenCL code as part of a SOP network.

:new:
    [Intersection analysis|Node:sop/intersectionanalysis] and [stitching|Node:sop/intersectionstitch] nodes for low-level handling of intersecting/touching geometry.

:improved:
    :fig:[Image:/images/nodes/sop/polybevel_radio.jpg]
        Enhanced [PolyBevel|Node:sop/polybevel].

:improved:
    Redesigned [Smooth node|Node:sop/smooth] for 3D and UV smoothing with advanced surface analysis. All tools that use smoothing, such as [Topobuild|Node:sop/topobuild], [Edit|Node:sop/edit], and [UV Edit|Node:sop/uvedit] now use the new smoothing engine.

:improved:
    The Normal SOP can now compute normals based on face area, which helps low-res bevels look smooth (set __Weighting method__ to "By face area"). The Normal SOP also has better handling of edge groups.

:improved:
    The [PolyExpand2D node|Node:sop/polyexpand2d] now supports variable width paths.

:improved:
    The [Find Shortest Path SOP|Node:sop/findshortestpath] now supports storing connectivity and costs in array attributes, to allow finding paths on point clouds.

:changed:
    The Copy SOP was split into new [Copy and Transform|Node:sop/copyxform], [Copy to Points|Node:sop/copytopoints], and [Copy Stamp|Node:sop/copy] nodes with simpler interfaces.

:changed:
    The Group SOP was split into multiple new nodes with simpler interfaces.


== Alembic ==

:improved:
    Support for `arbGeomParams` on transform nodes.

:improved:
    Easier manipulation of user properties.

:improved:
    Re-export Alembic with the same hierarchy.

:improved:
    Faster Alembic visibility cache.


== Misc ==

:new:
    The new [PolyPath SOP|Node:sop/polypath] helps clean up polygon curve topology.

:new:
    The new [Rewire Vertices SOP|Node:sop/rewire] bulk-reassigns vertices to points based on an attribute.

[Include:general#cuspedvertex]

:improved:
    Extensive OpenCL support.

:improved:
    Updated OpenSubdiv from 2.5.1 to 3.0.5.

:improved:
    Aggressive geometry compression.

:improved:
    Improved geometry performance and lower memory usage through caching and memory sharing.

:improved:
    Faster saving and loading of `.bgeo` files containing many polygon primitives or tetrahedra if saved in Houdini 16.  Loading these files in 15.5 or 15.0 requires either a recent build of them, or setting the `HOUDINI15_5_GEO_COMPATIBILITY` environment variable to 1 when saving in 16.0.
