= What's new in Houdini 15 |> Animation =

== General ==

=== Onion-skinning ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    Per-object [onion-skinning|/character/onionskinning] in the viewport. Use the __Onion skinning__ menu on the __Misc__ tab of the geometry object to choose between "Transform only" and "Deforming" onion skinning. You can set the number of before and after frames and other settings in the scene view's display options.

=== Orient by object ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    Objects now have a __Look up__ parameter. This is like the __Look at__ parameter, but it sets the object's up vector to point at another object. This makes it easy to animate path following and orientation without expressions.

=== Keep position changed ===
#display: pull left

:changed:
    Instead of a global __Keep position when moving parent__ checkbox in the preferences, there is now a default __Child compensation__ preference, and per-object settings on each object's __Transform__ tab.
    
    When "Child compensation" is on, moving an object does not change the position of its children (their transforms are edited to compensate for the change).
    
    For convenience, __Keep position when parenting__ and __Child compensation__ are available as options in the toolbar of the Move tool.

=== New preferences ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    __Auto-key tuples parameters__ (on by default): enables __Auto-key__ for tuple parameters. This is important when animating with the handles.

:new:
    __Scope parameters with animation__ (on by default): the [animation editor|/ref/panes/animeditor] will scope any parameters that have animation, so you don't have to set auto-scope on parameters or manually scope them.

:new:
    __Set auto-scope flag when creating channels__ (off by default): automatically turns on the auto-scope flag on creating a channel. This is for unusual cases where __Scope parameters with animation__ is not enough.

== Animation editor ==

=== Improved interaction ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    The new Ripple tool lets you easily shift groups of keys in the [dopesheet|/ref/panes/dopesheet].
    
    [Image:/images/char/dopesheet_ripple.png]

:new:
    You can now box-select multiple keys and transform or stretch them in the [dopesheet|/ref/panes/dopesheet] and timeline.

:new:
    Improved selection in the [graph editor|/ref/panes/changraph].

:new:
    The ((=)) hotkey now sets the selected keyframes to automatic slope. The ((-)) hotkey sets the selected keyframes to manual slope. This is easier to use than the previous behavior where ((=)) toggled between the two modes.

:changed:
    Smooth Selected and Auto-Slope now normalize the acceleration. If you want to change acceleration, you must set the keys to have manual slope.

:fixed:
    Dope sheet selections now support undo/redo.

=== Channel extend ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    You can cycle animation outside the keyframe range (default, hold, extend, cycle, slope, cycle offset, or oscillate). In the graph editor, choose __Channels > Edit channel properties__.

    You can also bake out cycles into real keyframe animation.

=== New controls ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    New paste methods and settings in the menu.

:new:
    Added new menu items to edit scoped channels in the animation editor and the channel list.

== Character animation ==

=== Simple biped ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    Textured female and male versions of the simple biped rig.

:changed:
    The Simple Biped rig now has onion skinning, render as subdivision, and squash and stretch controls.

=== New pane types ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    New [character picker|/pypanel/charpicker] and new [pose library|/pypanel/poselibrary] panes, implemented as Python panels. These may be useful on their own or as an example of building a character interface in a Python panel.
    
    [Image:/images/char/pose_library.jpg]

:new:
    The [Capture Attribute Pack|Node:sop/captureattribpack] and [Capture Attribute Unpack|Node:sop/captureattribunpack] geometry nodes convert between traditional "index pair" storage of capture attributes, and a group of named array attributes. The array representation is easy to bind and manipulate in VEX, but does not support interpolation. This work supports future efforts to move custom rigging from SOPs to VOPs.

=== Easier bone selection ===
#display: pull left

:changed:
    You can now select wireframe (X-ray) bones by clicking inside the bone (as if they were solid).

== Other changes and improvements ==

=== Pre-transforms ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    You can add a pre-transform parameters to an object's interface. In the parameter editor, click the [Smallicon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu and choose __Edit parameter interface__, then drag over the __Pre-transform__ folder from the __Node properties__ tab.

=== Bake keyframes ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    You can now bake keyframes from the parameter ((RMB)) context menu.

=== Scripting ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    The [Python Script object|Node:obj/pythonscript] lets you generate an object transform from a Python script. The node includes examples in the presets menu for the script field.

:new:
    The new [Hom:hou.Parm#setKeyframes] method is more efficient than calling [Hom:hou.Parm#setKeyframe] multiple times.

=== Pane layout ===
#display: pull left

:changed:
    Changes to the "Animate" pane layout:
    
    * Included the [Character Picker|/pypanel/charpicker] pane.
    
    * Removed the Take List and added a Tree View.

=== CHOPs ===
#display: pull left

:fixed:
    The [Dynamics CHOP|Node:chop/dynamics] now writes clips with the requested sample rate in Dynamic mode. Previously it set the sample rate to 1, which would cause problems when the output was wired into a [Record CHOP|Node:chop/record].

=== Misc ===
#display: pull left

:changed:
    The [chinfo|/ref/utils/chinfo] and [chread|/ref/utils/chread] utilities have a new `-s` option to skip printing per-segment information. This makes it easier to get just the channel list.

:changed:
    Added frame numbers on small ticks in the timeline when there's enough space.

:fixed:
    MPlay character blocking workflow.
