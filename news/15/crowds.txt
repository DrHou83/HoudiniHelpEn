= What's new in Houdini 15 |> Crowds =

=== Ragdoll dynamics ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    You can now switch agents to a [rag doll|/crowds/ragdoll] state.

    The [Collision Layer|Node:sop/agentcollisionlayer] and [Configure Joints|Node:sop/agentconfigurejoints] tools on the __Crowds__ shelf tab let you set up collision geometry and joint rotation limits for rag dolling.
    
    The Bullet solver solves the ragdolls.
    
    * You can use standard DOPs techniques to alter constraints, for example to have agents drop objects or detach limbs.
    
    * Ragdolls interact with other simulation types such as FLIP fluids and POP grains.

=== Behavior ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    Houdini now has DOP and VOP nodes to allow creating [fuzzy logic|/crowds/fuzzy] "brains" to drive agent behavior.

:new:
    Support for subsumption logic allows better collision avoidance and more natural turning.

:new:
    Terrain adapation now supports an arbitrary number of lower limbs.

=== Shape layers ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    [Agent Layer geometry node|Node:sop/agentlayer] can now add deforming shapes to the layer.

:new:
    Option on [Crowd Source geometry node|Node:sop/crowdsource] to randomize each agent's current shape layer.

:new:
    New __Keep external references__ parameter in the [Agent|Node:sop/agent] and [Crowd Source|Node:sop/crowdsource] geometry nodes lets you choose whether to reference agent definition files on disk. Turning this off allows self-contained (but larger) geometry files when you export agent primitives to disk.

:new:
    The [Agent ROP|Node:out/agent] can now write out agent definition files for an existing agent primitive.

:new:
    Added support for orientation when converting agent clips to in-place animation in the [Agent render node|Node:out/agent].

:changed:
    Changed [agent network structure|/crowds/setup] to allow modifying agent primitives (for example, adding ragdoll metadata) before sourcing them.

:changed:
    New __Start clip at frame 1__ parameter on the [Agent geometry node|Node:sop/agent] and [Agent render node|Node:out/agent] bakes clips starting at frame 1. This defaults to true on new nodes.

:new:
    Added parameters for pre-render and post-render scripts to the [Agent render node|Node:out/agent].

=== Shelf tools ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    [Agent Cam tool|/shelf/crowds_agentcam] creates a camera and attaches it to the head of an agent for point of view shots.

:new:
    [Target Position|Node:dop/popsteerseek] tool makes agents move toward a target.

=== Viewport ===
#display: pull left

:fixed:
    Deforming agents now properly occlude other geometry.

:fixed:
    You can now set the view pivot on deforming agents using ((Space + Z)).

:fixed:
    The base discs of agents in the selected object are now drawn selected.

:fixed:
    Agent shapes with primitive color (`Cd`) attributes are now colored in the viewport. Previously only point, detail, and vertex `Cd` attributes were supported.

=== Shading and rendering ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    [Material stylesheets|/shade/stylesheets] allow you to change materials and material parameters per-agent.

:changed:
    The [Agent Mantra Procedural shader|Node:shop/vm_geo_agent] is now available if you need to override default settings for rendering agents, for example level of detail (LOD) settings.

=== VEX/VOPs ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    New VEX functions [Vex:agentlocaltransform], [Vex:agentworldtransform], [Vex:setagentlocaltransform], [Vex:setagentworldtransform] for reading and writing specific agent transforms. These are much faster than functions such as [Vex:agentlocaltransforms] that work on all an agent's transforms.

:new:
    The [Agent Add Clip VOP|Node:vop/agentaddclip] lets you add clips to an existing agent. This is a wraper for the [Vex:agentaddclip] VEX function.

=== Misc ===
#display: pull left

:changed:
    The default for converting animation to in-place when baking clips is to place the agent at the origin (instead of at the position in the first frame). To get the old behavior, turn on __Use pivot from first frame__ on the [Agent SOP|Node:sop/agent] _and_ the [Agent render node|Node:out/agent].

:changed:
    The [Agent|Node:sop/agent] and [Crowd Source|Node:sop/crowdsource] geometry nodes now generate warnings if clips have different numbers of channels, to help diagnose naming or overwriting problems where a clip was baked with a different rig.

:changed:
    Agent locomotion transforms are now called `__locomotion__`.

:changed:
    Renamed __Start clip at frame 1__ to __Shift clip to frame 1__ on agent nodes.

:changed:
    The Agent nodes now always bake out agents with the `__locomotion__` rig transform. If the __Locomotion node__ parameter is empty, it uses the __Object subnet__.

:changed:
    You can now turn off __Update Particles__ on the Crowd Solver node to disable its internal particle solver. This allows you to use the node as a microsolver.

:fixed:
    Houdini now supports deforming curves in packed agent geometry.

:fixed:
    Faster playback for crowds in file caches that use external file references. In one case, playback went from 4 FPS to 15 FPS.

:fixed:
    The [Agent Look At|Node:dop/agentlookat] and [Agent Look At Apply|Node:dop/agentlookatapply] DOP nodes are much faster.

:fixed:
    The [Agent SOP|Node:sop/agent] now warns when loading a layer definition with an invalid shape binding, instead of continuing in an inconsistent state and possibly crashing.
