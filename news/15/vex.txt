See also [what's new in shading|rendering#shading].

== VOPs ==

=== Control structures ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    "For...", "For...Until", "For Each...", and "For Each...Until" nodes allow looping the nodes between them. See the [documentation on looping|/shade/looping].

=== Easy visualization ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    [Visualize VOP|Node:vop/visualize] helps visualize the value of a VOP output in the viewport. It adds a `vis_*` attribute based on the output value and sets some visualization options to make it show up in the viewport. You can hover over a VOP output and press ((X)) to rewire a visualize node onto that output.
    
    The intention is to later replace this somewhat inefficient method with something integrated with the [visualization editor|/basics/visualizers].

=== Snippets ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    The [Snippet VOP|Node:vop/snippet], forced code generation is now optional. If you know the snippet has no side effects, you can turn off forced generation, so Houdini will only generate the code if it's needed.

=== Misc ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    [Neighbors VOP|Node:vop/neighbours] generates an array of the nearest points, suitable for looping for with a [For Each block|/shade/looping].

:new:
    [Ray Import VOP|Node:vop/rayimport].

:new:
    [Make Transform Space VOP|Node:vop/transformspace] generates a matrix to transform from one space to another (for example, an object's local space to world space).

:new:
    "Matrix to Vector" and "Vector to Matrix" VOPs to extract rows from a matrix, and construct a matrix from rows.

:new:
    Code caching gives faster compilation of VEX code generated from VOPs.

:changed:
    The [Density to Opacity VOP|Node:vop/densitytoopacity] is now only available in the Surface and Fog contexts because it uses the [Is Shadow VOP|Node:vop/isshadow].

:changed:
    The File VOPs have been consolidated with the node input versions.

:changed:
    New [Get Attribute VOP|Node:vop/getattrib] version supports arrays and default values.

:changed:
    The [Tangent Normal|Node:vop/tangentnormal] and [Tangent Normal Remap|Node:vop/tangentnormalremap] nodes now support arbitrary tangents.

:fixed:
    Hidden Ramp Parameter nodes now show as a peg, like hidden Parameter nodes.

== VEX ==

=== Literals ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    You can now use binary constants, for example `0b00110011`.

:changed:
    You can now use `_` as a number separator in VEX, for example `random(1_000_000)`, to make long numbers more readable.

:changed:
    The number `019` is now a syntax error (as invalid octal) instead of being silently treated as decimal.
