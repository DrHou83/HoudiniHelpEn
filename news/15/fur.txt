= What's new in Houdini 15 |> Hair and fur =

=== Grooming ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    Improvements to [Curve Groom|Node:sop/curvegroom] node:

    * New lifting behavior and controls. Lifting with strengths from 0 to 1 should be much more natural now.
    
    * New __Lock roots__ option. Turning this off allows hairs to move along the surface.
    
    * New __Constrain length__ option. Turning this off allows hairs to grow or shrink.

    * Hair advection is faster.

:new:
    New __Method__ menu for transferring a groom to another skin geometry, on the __Skin__ tab of the [Fur object|Node:obj/fur]

:fixed:
    Improved internals and use of subdivision curves give much faster user interaction and better artistic control.

=== Subdivision curves ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    Added subdivision curves as an option on the [Fur object|Node:obj/fur]. This uses polylines for the hairs, and subdivides them at display/render time. This gives substantial speed-ups over NURBS.

=== Viewport display ===
#display: pull left

:new:
    Improved display of fur/hair in the viewport. Hair thickness, subdivision curves, and hair shadows display properly in the viewport's high quality display mode.

=== Hair material ===
#display: pull left

:changed:
    Updated hair shader VOP and hair material in the material gallery.

    * New layout similar to the new Mantra Surface.
    
    * Exposed reflection size and shift parameters from the Hair Model VOP.
    
    * Removed the overall color ramp. Color is now controlled by the root and tip color, each with an optional texture map, and ramp to blend between them. A new __Separate tip color__ parameter controls whether the tip color is different from the root.
    
    * Optional randomization of diffuse HSV and specular intensity values per-hair.

=== Misc ===
#display: pull left

:fixed:
    The fur object's group parameters now have [Smallicon:BUTTONS/reselect] Reselect buttons.

:fixed:
    The render view now updates on changes to `clumpmap` and `clumpmapblending` attributes on the fur object.
