    [Image:/news/15_5/images/uvlayout.png]

:improved:
    Faster saving of large polygon soups under some conditions, most notably IPR renders.

== User experience ==

:new:
    You can now copy and paste multiple rows and columns in the Parameter Spreadsheet. You can use this to copy all channel references on a node to another node at once.

:new:
    The viewport now shows displacements for surfaces with a __GL Displacement map__ parameter. See the [Icon:ROP/opengl] [Open GL ROP|Node:out/opengl] and on the __Effects__ tab of the [3D Display options|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d]. This feature requires OpenGL 4.0.

:new:
    New option for Euler tumbling in the viewport allows you to tumble the view over the poles.

:new:
    Ability to double-click for [edge loop selection|/basics/select#selecting-edge-loops] as well as create multiple loops.
    
    [Image:/news/15_5/images/edgeloop_multi.png]

    
:new:
    Double-click points or primitives to select connected geometry in the viewport.

:improved:
    Cleaner help layout and improved search.
    
    * You can switch the display of lists of items such as [HOM methods|Hom:hou.Node] and [environment variables|/ref/env] to alphabetical order.
    
    * The search now shows "inline" results for nodes, VEX functions, HOM functions/methods, HScript commands and expressions, and common attributes.
    
    * A list of categories to the left of search results lets you filter the results quickly.
    
    [Image:/images/new/instant_answers.png]

:improved:
    :fig:[Image:/images/ui/handle_rotate_anno.png]
    
        Various [handle UI improvements|/ref/windows/mainprefs#handles] including the display of an outer ring for rotating around the current view axis, the ability to turn off negative axis drawing of translate handles, and the display small draggable translate planes away from the center of the handle. For information, see [Using handles|/basics/handles].
    
:improved:
    Improvements to the File Chooser.
    
:improved:
    Better geometry snapping, including the ability to snap to X-ray geometry.
    
:fixed:
    Overlapping multi-selections in Dopesheet and Playbar.

== Crowds ==

:new:
    New [foot planting workflow|/crowds/footplanting] supported by new parameters on various nodes.

:new:
    [Transition graphs|/crowds/transitions] let you specify multi-clip transitions at specific frames between agent states.

:new:
    You can now directly [import|Node:sop/agent] or [render|Node:out/agent] FBX characters as agents.

:new:
    Added many new controls to the [Icon:CROWDS/state] [Crowd State DOP|Node:dop/crowdstate] for animation clips, such as options for adjusting the clip and/or locomotion speed, retiming behavior, and allowed speed variance.

:new:
    The new [Icon:CROWDS/agentterrainadaptation] [Agent Terrain Adaptation SOP|Node:sop/agentterrainadaptation] lets you add terrain adaptation to animated agents after a simulation, or use it for simple crowd shots that don't involve simulation.

:new:
    New [Icon:CROWDS/agent] [Agent CHOP|Node:chop/agent] imports clips from an agent primitive into CHOPs.
    
:new:
    New [Icon:CROWDS/agent] [Mocap Biped 3|Node:obj/mocapbiped3] character on the __Character__ shelf tab. This character has better walk cycles, making it useful to test the new foot-planting features.
    
:new:
    Houdini now uses vertex normals when deforming agent shapes. This is particularly useful for FBX files, since they typically have vertex normals.

:new:
    Added support for baking additional (non-transform) channels into agents' animation clips. The new [Icon:CHOP/footplant] [Foot Plant CHOP|Node:chop/footplant] uses this to add channels describing when a foot is planted.

:changed:
    New versions of the [Crowd Solver|Node:dop/crowdsolver], [Crowd State DOP|Node:dop/crowdstate], [Crowd Transition DOP|Node:dop/crowdtransition], [Crowd Source SOP|Node:sop/crowdsource], [Agent Prep SOP|Node:sop/agentprep], and [Agent Terrain Adaptation DOP|Node:dop/agentterrainadaptation].
    
    The new versions move, rename, and reorganize some parameters to make the behavior of and interaction between the parameters clearer.

:changed:
    The [Icon:CROWDS/crowdsource] [Crowd Source SOP|Node:sop/crowdsource] is now optional. Any required attributes are initialized by the crowd solver if they don't already exist.
    
:changed:
    Redesigned parameter interface for crowds 

:changed:
    Added support for agents that do not face down +Z and/or are not Y-up.
    
:changed:
    The [Icon:SOP/agentconfigurejoints] [Agent Configure Joints SOP|Node:sop/agentconfigurejoints] can now automatically compute initial joint limits from an agent's animation clips.

:improved:
    Crowd steering behavior, which reduces sliding and spinning for agents.

:improved:
    Support for locomotive clips, specifically looping and transitioning between locomotive clips.

:improved:
    Usability and robustness of the [crowd shelf tools|/shelf/crowds].
    
:improved:
    Terrain adaptation and support for foot locking.
    
:improved:
    Enhanced clip-driven transition controls for crowds.


== Lighting and rendering ==

:new:
    [Icon:SHOP/vrlens] [VR lens shader|Node:shop/v_vrlens], which supports standard projection modes (latlong/cubemap), as well as control over eye separation and eye/neck distance. The Oculus Rift headset is being used to validate the output image format. A __Perspective__ mode has also been added to the shader, to allow rendering of stereo pairs.
    
    [Image:/news/15_5/images/vr.png]
    
:new:
    There is now curvature support for UV Bake. This is done with a new [Curvature VOP|Node:vop/curvature] that provides various properties of surface curvature, such as Gaussian, mean, convexity, concavity, and magnitude. Curvature can be used to add wear to surfaces, and as a control mask for dirt and rust. An output is now available on the [Icon:SHOP/vrlens] [VR lens shader|Node:shop/v_vrlens] for this type of shading.
    
    [Image:/news/15_5/images/curvature.png]

:new:
    __Depth of Field__ and __Motion Blur__ are now available in the [Icon:ROP/opengl][OpenGL ROP|Node:out/opengl].

:new:
    Third party rendering in Houdini Indie.
    
:new:
    You can now add a [Mantra:vm_photonmodifier] property to objects to control how Mantra traces photons through the scene.

:new:
    New [Icon:VOP/uvtriplanarproject] [UV Triplanar Projection VOP|Node:vop/uvtriplanarprojection] lets you project repeating textures onto geometry easily.
    
    [Image:/images/shade/triplanar_project.jpg]
    
    [Image:/news/15_5/images/triplanar_axis.png][Image:/news/15_5/images/triplanar_seam.png]

:new:
    SOHO output drivers have a __Render to Disk in Background__ button.  This works like all other __Render ... in Background__ buttons, requiring a saved `.hip` file to work properly.
    
:changed:
    The Bake Shader has been removed, with the functionality being moved into the [Icon:SHOP/vrlens] [VR lens shader|Node:shop/v_vrlens]. This means that any image plane can be baked, as opposed to be limited to a fixed set of planes.

:changed:
    Bake shading controls have been moved from the Bake Texture ROP to standard shaders, which means bake settings can be adjusted on a per-object basis.

:improved:
    HQueue performance optimizations. The web interface and RPC are significantly more responsive.
    
:improved:
    Optimized tree view picker for the [Icon:SOP/alembic] [Alembic SOP|Node:sop/alembic]
    
:improved:
    [Icon:SOP/alembic] [Alembic ROP's|Node:out/alembic] exporting of packed fragment primitives.

:improved:
    The point replicate procedural now has an option to unpack the template geometry.

:fixed:
    You can now render extra “overscan” image data outside the display window in image formats that support it (for example `.pic` and `.exr`). This extra image data may be useful to other software such as Nuke.


== Hair, Fur, and Grooming ==

:new:
    You can now change selections within a single [Curve Groom SOP|Node:sop/curvegroom].
    
:new:
    A __Length Scale__ parameter on the __Appearance__ tab of the [Icon:SOP/fur] [Fur Object|Node:obj/fur] allows for small post groom adjustments.
    
:new:
    UDIM support for hair shader textures.

:new:
    Parameter to control which attributes to keep on external guides.

:new:
    Hair shader asset. The hair material in the gallery and the Fur object both use this, so from now on they will be in sync.

:improved:
    When the current object is a fur object or you are inside a fur object, the skin painting tools will use that object without asking for a selection.
    
:improved:
    Restored stroke caching in the [Curve Groom SOP|Node:sop/curvegroom].

:fixed:
    Fixed a bug where attributes called "prim" and "primuv" were created on external guides when __Snap to Skin__ was on.

:fixed:
    Fixed a bug where creating a new Curve Groom node using one of the grooming shelf tools (for example using Ctrl+Click or after selecting a different set of primitives) copied invisible parameters, which could cause cached guide geometry to be transferred to the new SOP. 


== Scripting ==

:new:
    You can now script the creation of flipbooks. See [Hom:hou.FlipbookSettings].

== VEX ==

:improved:
    Faster VEX loading and lower memory usage. This affects all VEX code from Wrangle SOPs to Mantra shaders.
