= Managing simulation networks =

The [Icon:BUTTONS/resimulate] simulation menu button in the bottom right corner of the main window allows you to control simulations.

:task:Turn all simulations on or off:
    Click the simulation menu button to switch between simulation on and off.
        
    _or_
        
    Right-click or press and hold on the button and use the __Enable simulation__ menu item.

:task:Reset the simulation:
    Shift-click the simulation menu button.

:task:Set which DOP network the shelf tools will create new dynamics nodes in:
    Right-click or press and hold on the button and open the __Current simulation__ sub-menu. Choose the DOP network you want the shelf tools to affect.
        
:task:Create a new DOP network at the Scene level:
    Right-click or press and hold on the button and choose __Create new simulation__.
    
    *Note*: if it does not already exist, the shelf tools will create a new DOP network at the scene level called `AutoDopNetwork` automatically. So it is only necessary to use this command if you want additional DOP networks for some reason.
        
    This command creates a new numbered `AutoDopNetwork` DOP network node at the scene level.
