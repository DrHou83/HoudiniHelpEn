== Control the shape of fractured pieces ==

There are two ways to control the fracture shape. You could use point distribution or cluster pieces together. 

Point distribution: 

    Each point becomes the center of a convex piece. So if you place points equally along a line, you get a series of slices. If you concentrate them in one area, you get small pieces in that area with larger pieces outside.

Clustering pieces together:
    There are three main ways of clustering pieces together. 

    Cluster attribute:
        Pieces with the same cluster attribute that are connected will be fused into one piece. The cluster attribute is on the points. 

    Cluster noise:
        This is simply some noise on a cluster attribute causing pieces to spontaneously fuse. 

    Random detachment:
        After clustering, pieces will break off according to the detach ratio.



== Control scattering of pieces ==

There are no built in tools for scattering, but you can always paint a density attribute, which is read by the [Scatter SOP|Node:sop/scatter] to control generation of the piece centers. You could also paint the cluster attribute.



== Control the shape and texturing of inside pieces ==

By default the interiors are always flat planes; however, you can enable the __Add Interior Detail__ checkbox on the __Interior Detail__ tab of the [Voronoi Fracture SOP|Node:sop/voronoifracture] node. This gives you access to parameters to bricker the flat planes and add some noise. 

NOTE:
    The __Depth/Noise Ramp__ is useful to ensure no noise is at the edge, so that everything matches up nicely.



== Create a volumetric fracture map ==

You can use the cluster attribute to control your cutting.

For example, if you have a boundary you want to cut along, you can seed points along the boundary and then make two copies offset in opposite directions. Set one copy to cluster 1 and the other to cluster 2. If these are used for the piece centers you will create a bunch of splintery pieces laying next to your desired cut boundary, which will be fused together.
