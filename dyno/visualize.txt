== Slices ==

* Remember that the slice is just that: a 2D slice through a 3D volume, and so sometimes it can be deceiving. For example, at a particular moment a temperature slice might look like there's no temperature in your container, when in fact there just happens to be no temperature _in that slice_.

    You might try moving the slice or switching to a smoke visualization occasionally.

* To eyeball what temperatures are present where in your effect, turn on visualization of the temperature field ([Smoke object|Node:dop/smokeobject] > Guides tab > Temperature tab). Then use the __Guide range__ parameters to adjust the minimum and maximum temperatures visualized (the [ladder control|/basics/ladder] is useful here).
    
    For example, to see the correlation between temperature and shredding, turn on the temperature and shredding visualizations, and on the smoke object's temperature visualization tab, set the __Guide range__ to the range of temperatures where shredding occurs (controlled by [Pyro solver|Node:dop/pyrosolver] > Shape tab > Shredding tab, __Temperature threshold__ and __Threshold width__).

== Streamers ==

* To hide very low velocities so you can focus on more meaningful streamers, increase the __Streamer Minimum Speed__.

* You can eyeball a rough estimate of the maximum speed in a sim by decreasing the maximum __Visualization Range__ value until just before all red (in the Infra-Red color mode) disappears from the streamers. The maximum value is then roughly the maximum velocity in the system.

== Show an object's collision representation == (collision)

The dynamics engine uses a simplified version of an object's geometry to calculate collisions.

To show this geometry in the viewer, show the object's parameters and click the __Collisions__ tab, then the __Volume__ sub-tab, then turn on __Show collision guide geometry__.

== Cloth and wire visualization ==

The [Cloth Object|Node:dop/clothobject] and [Wire Object|Node:dop/wireobject] have __Visualization__ tabs that let you show the effects of forces on the object as colored lines.

The most important forces for cloth are external forces, collision forces, impacts, stretch energy, and sometimes stretch force and biphasic force.

== Fluid visualizations == (fluids)

# Select the [Smoke|Node:dop/smokeobject] (density) or [Fluid|Node:dop/fluidobject] (sign distance) box you want to visualize. If you're not already in the dynamics network, choose the [Icon:TOOLS/select] Select tool and [Icon:TOOLS/select_dynamics] Dynamics selection mode, then click the box in the viewer.

# In the parameter editor, click the __Guides__ tab at the bottom.

The __Guides__ tab contains many sub-tabs with controls for visualizing different aspects of the field. For example, you can use the controls on the __Velocity__ sub-tab to view the velocity of the contained gas/fluid at each point using lines, or through a plane using streamers.

== Using visualization geometry ==

You can import visualization geometry into a geometry network just as you can import the actual surface or volume of an object. See the section on [importing and exporting simulation data|io].
