"""Lets you drag a box in the viewer to render an automatically updating preview of that part of the view."""

== Overview ==

This tool lets you draw a rectangle in the 3D viewer that acts like a mini [render view|/ref/views/ipr]. It renders that part of the view and updates the rendered rectangle as you move lights and objects, tumble the view, and edit parameters.

== How to ==

:task:Render a region of the 3D view:
    # Click the [Icon:TOOLS/render_region] Render Region tool on the left side of the viewport.
    
    # Drag a rectangle in the viewer over the region to render.

:task:Remove the rendered region:
    Hover over the region and click the [Icon:BUTTONS/close] close button in the top right corner.

:task:Move or resize the rendered region:
    * Drag the bar across the top of the region to move it.

    * Drag one of the corners to resize it.

    * Click the maximize button in the top right corner to render the entire 3D view.

:task:Edit render preview settings:
    When the tool is selected, use the controls in the operation toolbar at the top of the viewer. These options are the same as the options in the [render view|/ref/views/ipr].
    
    You can use a pop-up menu in the operation toolbar to choose which [render node|render] to use to render the preview.

:task:Visualize a different image plane:
    If the render node exports additional image planes, Right-click on the bar at the top of the region and choose the plane from the __Image plane__ sub-menu.

:task:Turn off rendered background:
    Right-click on the bar at the top of the region and choose __Blend with viewport__.

    This disables rendering the background color to make the rendered objects blend visually with the rest of the 3D view.
