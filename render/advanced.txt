== Advanced dicing control ==

The dicing control properties are not available by default. You must use the properties interface to add them to the render output driver, camera, or object. See [properties|/props/] for more information. The dicing properties are under `mantra X.X/Dicing`.

The dicing properties have similar controls for scanline dicing (for the micropolygon scanline renderer) and ray sampling (for the raytracer).

Dicing flatness:
    Normally the dicer tries to represent flat surfaces with fewer polygons. Turn this option _down_ for more accurate (less optimized) flat surfaces.

Scanline measuring:
    Non-raster measuring:
        The new dicing algorithm, which can use the Z-coordinate to influence the dicing, by the amount specified in the __Z-importance__ parameter (see below).
        
        This is the default, with Z-importance set to 0, which is essentially the same as setting this to __Raster space measuring__ (the old algorithm).
        
    Raster space measuring:
        The old algorithm, which only uses the XY grid of the output image pixel grid to control the dicing.
        
    Uniform measuring:
        Dices everything equally, independent of screen space.
        
        This may be useful on a per-object basis if you have an object very close to the camera, and you want to dice it the same as everything else in the image.

Z-Importance:
    Ratio of Z-size to raster size. Turn this up for better detail on displaced surfaces viewed edge-on by the camera.

Measure Scale/Ray Measure Scale:
    For uniform dicing, the measure scale determines the micropolygon size. Larger values produce smaller micropolygons.
    
Ray Measuring/Ray Z-Importance:
    Same as __Scanline measuring__, but for raytracing. The default for Z importance is 1 for raytracing instead of 0.

Ray predicing:
    This optimization caches raytracing information to speed up raytracing of diced surfaces (for example subdivision surfaces) at the cost of using more memory.

Ray Shading Quality Multiplier:
    The shading quality multiplier when raytracing. See __Shading Quality Multiplier__ below.

Ray Shading Quality:
    The shading quality when raytracing. See __Shading Quality__ below.

Shading Quality Multiplier:
    This setting is a global multiplier on all shading qualities in the scene. Increasing this value will increase the shading quality for all objects.

Shading Quality:
    The shading quality for scanline rendering. A higher quality will generate smaller micro-polygons meaning more shading and sampling will occur, but the quality will be higher.
