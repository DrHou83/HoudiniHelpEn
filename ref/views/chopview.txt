= Motion FX view =

This viewer shows the sample data passing through channel nodes (CHOPs).

<!--
TBD.
-->

:task:Scope a CHOP node in the network view:
    * Click the node's graph flag. Shift-click to add/remove the
      node to/from the scope.

:task:Select channels to scope from a list:
    # Open the __Options__ menu in the toolbar and turn on __Scoping
      Tools__.

    # To add channels, choose them from the + pop-up menu. To remove
      channels, choose them from the - pop-up menu. To set channels,
      choose from the = pop-up menu.

:task:Edit sample data:
    * See  [edit raw samples|#ref_panes_chopview_rawedit] .

:task:Add a text note to the graph:
    # Click the Frame Indicator icon in the toolbar to show the blue
      vertical "current frame" line.

    # Drag the blue frame line to the frame you want to annotate.

    # Click the Toggle Options icon in the toolbar to switch to the
      annotation toolbar.

    # Choose the CHOP you want to annotate from the pop-up menu.

    # Type the note in the text box and press ((Enter)). The text
      will appear on the graph at the current frame.

== Mouse shortcuts in the graph ==

((Shift + LMB)) |
     Set the current CHOP.
((Ctrl + LMB)) |
     Set the current frame.
((Alt + LMB)) |
     Set the current CHOP and frame to the nearest sample.
((MMB)) |
     Scale the graph.
((Shift + MMB)) |
     Scale all graphs simultaneously.
((Ctrl + MMB)) |
     Constrain scaling to vertical or horizontal only.
((RMB)) |
     Pans across the graph.
((Shift + RMB)) |
     Pans across all graphs simultaneously.
((Ctrl + MMB)) |
    Constrain panning to vertical or horizontal only.

== Toolbar ==

Frame indicator:
    Click to show/hide a blue line indicating the current frame.
Auto scroll:
    Turn this on to have the viewer automatically follow the current
    frame during playback.
    
<!--
Options menu:
    TBD.
-->

Graphs menu:
    Lets you arrange the scoped parameters in separate graphs.
Horizontal/Vertical adapt:
    When these options are on, the viewer automatically pans and
    zooms to show all intervals and ranges of the scoped
    parameters.
Home graph:
    Pans and zooms the view to show all intervals and ranges of the
    scoped parameters.
Vertical adapt options menu:
    Controls which vertical range to use for homing the Graph or the
    Vertical Adapt button. __Auto__ (the default) uses the minimum
    and maximum values on the graph. Choose __Other__ to set the
    range explicitly. The other choices specify common range
    presets.
Disable graph:
    When this option is on, the graph does not update. Use this to
    speed up Houdini when you don't need the CHOP graph.
Toggle options:
    Switches between the toolbar and a text box you can use to
    annotate the current frame of a CHOP graph.
Curve/Bar display switch:
    Switches between displaying curves and sample bars.

== Options toolbar menu ==

Labels:
    Show channel names.
Handles:
    Show handles on the channel data, allowing you to edit it
    directly.
Dots:
    Show dots at each sample point. This is useful for finding
    sampling errors by visually examining the individual channel
    values.
Extend Regions:
    Shows the values obtained when sampling the channels outside the
    CHOP's range.
Raw Edit Tools:
    See  [editing raw samples|#ref_panes_chopview_rawedit] .
Scope Tools:
    Show menus for choosing scoped parameters.
Frames, Samples, Seconds:
    Sets the time unit used for the horizontal scale of the graph.
Grid Low, Grid Medium, Grid High:
    Sets the density of grid lines.

== Edit raw samples == (ref_panes_chopview_rawedit)

You can use the "raw edit" tools to directly set the values of
sample data. This is sometimes faster and simpler than the
alternative of fitting the data through smooth spline
approximations, and then editing them in the Animation Editor.

First, set up the viewer for editing:

# Open the __Options__ menu in the toolbar and turn on __Raw
  Edit Tools__ to show the editing tools under the graph.

# Turn on __Options > Dots__ and __Options > Handles__ as well.

Then, you can use various tools to edit samples:

* Click, Shift-click, and/or drag a marquee around samples to select
them.

* Drag a sample handle to change its value.

* Use the buttons in the raw edit toolbar:

=== Example ===

# Display three default Wave chops (one graph per CHOP).
  Turn on Dots, and click the Cubic icon. Turn on __Col
  Select__.

# Marquee select the first fifty frames of the first
  channel. The range is resampled as a cubic spline for all
  three channels.

# Drag a selected sample vertically, modifying the shape of
  the interpolation on all channels.

# Click the Copy Relative icon.

# Drag the selection to frame 100.

# Click an empty area of the graph to deselect. Click the
  Span Cubic icon again.

# Marquee select any area which appears to have a kink in
  it, and it will reinterpolate as a cubic shape.
