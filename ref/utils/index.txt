"""Houdini includes a large number of useful command-line utility programs."""

These programs are in the `bin` directory in the install directory.
Many of these programs are useful for batch processing scripts.

You can get usage information for most programs in `$HFS/bin` with

`<<program>> -h`

Or, in some cases,

`<<program>> -`
