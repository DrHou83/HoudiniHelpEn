"""Converts DXF polygons to/from Houdini format."""

gdxf is a standalone "polygon tool" that translates an AutoCad dxf
format file into a Houdini.hip file. The translator fully supports all
geometric entities except for the use of shape files. Entities such as
arcs, circles and polyarcs are converted to polygons. The "resolution
angle" used for this conversion may be changed using the-roption as
described below. Due to differences between dos and unix file systems,
"external references" are not supported.

If the -t option is used, the program will determine the layers in the
dxf file and output them.

== Usage 1 ==

    {{{
    gdxf [-k] [-b] [-a angle] infile.dxf outfile.[b]geo 
    }}}
    Converts AutoCAD `.dxf` files into Houdini `.[b]geo` files. All
    existing layers will be converted to groups.

== Usage 2 ==

    {{{
    gdxf -t [-i] infile.dxf 
    }}}
    Outputs the layers of the dxf file

== Usage 3 ==

    {{{
    gdxf [-v version] infile.[b]geo outfile.dxf 
    }}}
    Converts Houdini `.[b]geo` files to dxf files. All existing groups
    are converted to layers. Only polygons are handled.

`-h` :
    Display program help information (this is it).
`-b` :
    Output block insert information.
`-k` :
    Retain the end elements in extrusions of closed polygons.
`-t` :
    This option will determine the layers that are found in the input
    dxf file.
`-a` :
    Angle resolution. This indicates the maximum angle used between
    vertices in circles and arcs. For instance, an angle resolution of
    10 would create a circle with 36 vertices. The default is 10
    degrees.
`-v` :
    An AutoCAD version number.
