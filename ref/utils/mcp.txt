"""Convert an image sequence to a movie file."""

== Synopsis ==

    {{{
    mcp [-v] input_movie [input_audio] -o output_movie 
    }}}
== Description ==

    mcp converts a sequence of images to a single movie file, extracts 
    image frames from a movie file, or re-encodes a movie file.  The
    supported movie formats differ across platforms.  Run mcp without
    any arguments to see the usage instructions, which include a list of
    supported formats.

== Options ==

    -v:
        Enables verbose output.

    input_movie:
        is one of:

        filename.ext (where .ext is a supported input movie container extension)

        `[filename]` ...

        -f min max `[-i inc]` xxx$Fxxx

        -w width -h height -f 1 max stdin

        min is the minimum frame number
        max is maximum frame number
        inc is the frame increment
        $F is a placeholder for the frame number within filenames.

    input_audio:
        is: -a `[-x]` audio_file

        The -x option specifies that the audio is to be copied without
        transcoding.

        Note: This option is not supported on all formats.

    output_movie:
        is: `[-w width]` `[-h height]` `[-f min max]` `[-i inc]`

        `[-c compression]` `[-r framerate]` `[-l lib:format]` output_file

        Note: After a movie is read in, its frame numbers are renumbered
        to the range 1,2,3,... the -f and -i options of the output_movie
        act on the new range. The default frame rate is 24 frames per
        second.

    output_file:
        is one of:

        filename.ext (where .ext is a supported output movie container extension)

        xxx$Fxxx

        stdout

    -c <option_file>:
        Encoding some movie formats will display a dialog of available
        compression settings.  This option suppresses this dialog and
        reads the relevant compression settings from the specified file,
        created earlier using the '-C' option.  This option is not
        supported by all formats.  See the usage output from mcp for 
        details.

    -C <option_file>:
        Encoding some movie formats will display a dialog of available
        compression settings.  This option saves the chosen settings to
        the specified file so that they may be reused later with the '-c'
        option.  This option is not supported by all formats.  See the
        usage output from mcp for details.
        
== Examples ==

    {{{
    mcp
    }}}
    This will display the usage message, including supported formats.

    {{{
    mcp -v -f 1 40 CorkScrew\$F.pic -o CorkScrew.avi 
    }}}
    This will convert a sequence of images from 1-40 named
    _CorkScrew1.pic_... _CorkScrew40.pic_ to an avi file (if supported).

    To save and reuse compression sessions, try:

    {{{
    mcp -v -f 1 150 -i 1 input\$F.pic -o -C settings filename1.mp4
    }}}
    {{{
    mcp -v -f 1 150 -i 1 next_input\$F.pic -o -c settings filename2.mp4
    }}}
