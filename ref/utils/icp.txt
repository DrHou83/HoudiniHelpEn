"""Isolate a region of an image in a new image."""

== Synopsis ==

    {{{
    icp [-v] [-u] [-m] [-b] [res] [sub] <inimage> [sub] <outimage> iconvert [-d depth]
    }}}
    where:

    `res` is `[-w <<width>>] [-h <<height>>]`, and `sub` is `[-x
    <<xoff>>] [-y <<yoff>>] [-w <<width>>] [-h <<height>>]` or `[-d
    <<divs>> <<section>>]`.

== Description ==

    icp copies an image, or a portion thereof, from the inimage image to
    the _outimage_.

    Without any arguments, icp copies an entire image from the specified
    source to the destination. At any time, if the resolutions of the
    source image and the destination image differ, icp will copy the
    largest portion of the source which will fit within the destination
    image.

    If _outimage_ is of a different file type than _inimage_, then the
    file is converted to the new filetype automatically. For example:

    {{{
    icp myimage.sgi myimage.tif
    }}}
    ...converts _myimage.sgi_ to a _.tif_ format file.

    If the destination image is an existing file the -m option indicates
    to icp that the file is to be modified rather than re-created. This
    allows sub-frames to be copied into existing frames stored on disk
    without destroying the portion of the destination image outside the
    sub-image area.

    To avoid the internal allocation of memory for image storage, frames
    are copied on a per scanline basis, but may be overridden by
    specifying the -b block option, which reads/writes entire images in
    one operation.

    To keep images from being compressed, you can use the -u option
    (uncompressed). This avoids run-length encoding (RLE) for output
    formats that support it. This includes, Prisms/Houdini (.pic),
    Wavefront (.rla/.rlb) and Targa (.tga/.vst).

== Resolution + offset (Res) ==

    An arbitrary portion of an image may specified by defining its
    resolution and its offset from the origin of the image. The width
    and height of the sub-area are specified with the -w and -h options
    respectively. If one is omitted, its value will be the full width or
    height of the image. These options must be specified before the
    source image on the command line.

    Either the source or the destination image may have offsets
    specified for the sub-area. These are given with the -x and -y
    options. The offset options appearing in front of the source image
    apply to the source image, while those specified immediately before
    the destination apply to the destination. If one or both are
    omitted, their values default to zero.

    If offsets are specified without a resolution, then icp adjusts the
    resolution of the image appropriately for the given offset values.

== Divisions + image (SUB) ==

    A sub-image may be specified for either the source or the
    destination by specifying the -d option before the source and/or the
    destination. This option takes two values representing the number of
    sub-frames into which the image is to be divided and the sub-image
    number to be used for this copy operation.

    The number of sub-divisions must be the square of an integer. The
    sub-image number must be between zero and the number of
    sub-divisions -1 where sub-image 0 is at the top left corner and
    sub-image sub-divisions -1 is at the bottom right.

    As with the offset specifications, the option appearing in front of
    the source image applies to the source image, while that specified
    immediately before the destination applies to the destination.

    The two methods of specifying sub-areas of an image may be mixed so
    that one method is given for the source while the other is used for
    the destination. As mentioned above, any mis-match of resolutions
    will result in copying the largest portion of the source which will
    fit within the destination image area.

    The -v option will output a status message to the standard error
    file indicating the source, destination and resolution of the copy
    operation.

== Examples ==

    To copy the top-right corner of the iris into the top-right corner
    of a previously saved file with 512 x 384 resolution:

    {{{
    iclear -w 800 -h 600 temp.pic icp -m -d 4 1 marble.pic -d 4 1 ip 
    }}}
    To display the top half of an image:

    {{{
    icp -y 242 back.pic ip 
    }}}
