== Synopsis ==

{{{
#!sh
dsmmerge [-j nthreads] [-l opacitylimit] -o outputfile dsm1.rat dsm2.rat ...
}}}

== Description ==

Merges two or more deep shadow/camera maps
with correct depth compositing. This is the command-line equivalent
of the [DSM Merge render node|Node:out/dsmmerge].
See [Deep shadow maps|/render/lights#enabling-and-disabling-shadows] and [deep camera maps|/render/dcm]
for more information.

== Options ==

`-j`:
    Configure the maximum threads to the value specified.  The default is to
    use all processors.  See help for HOUDINI_MAXTHREADS for further details.

`-l`:
    Opacity limit: once the program reaches this opacity in a pixel, it
    will stop compositing. This can save time when compositing volumes
    where the opacity can build up to a point that's practically opaque
    but not actually `1.0`. The default is `1.0`.
    
`-o`:
    The name of the output file. This is required.
