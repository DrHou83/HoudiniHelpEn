"""Makes a ptexture image file from a geometry file."""

`gptex` reads a geometry file and generates a ptexture file containing an image for each face in the geometry.

== Usage ==

You can specify image files for each face on the command line, or use the `-f` option to specify a text file containing an image file name on each line.

# `gptex <<geofile>> <<ptexfile>> [<<imagefile>> ...]`

# `gptex -f <<map_list_file>> <<geofile>> <<ptexfile>>`

== Notes ==

* The geometry file must contain four sided polygons.

* The image files must be power of 2 in their resolution.

* All image files must have the same number of color channels and storage type (for example, if one image is 8 bit RGB, all images must be 8 bit RGB).

== Options ==

`-v`:
    (Verbose) Print information about progress.
    
`-f <<map_list_file>>`:
    Read individual face textures from the a text file.

== Examples ===

Generate a `ptexture` file for a cube with the 6 image files specified:

{{{
#!sh
gptex box.geo box.ptx face0.pic face1.exr face2.tif face3.pic face4.png face5.pic
}}}

Generate a `ptexture` file for a more complicated model, using the file
`maplist.txt` to specify the `filenames` for each face texture, printing progress information to `stdout`:

{{{
#!sh
gptex -v -f maplist.txt model.bgeo model.ptx
}}}
