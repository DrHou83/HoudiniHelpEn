= iinfo =

"""Outputs information about an image."""

== Synopsis ==

{{{
iinfo [-i] [-s] imagefile [imagefile*] 
}}}
where:

`-i`:
    Checks the image file's integrity. If the file is corrupted in
    any way, the line: Integrity: File bad will appear in the
    output. Otherwise, Integrity: File OK will appear. If any of the
    read files read are bad, iinfo will exit with error status 1; if
    they are all good, it returns status 0.
`-s`:
    Suppresses output. When used in conjunction with the -i option,
    the exit status can be used in shell scripts to test the
    integrity of image files.
