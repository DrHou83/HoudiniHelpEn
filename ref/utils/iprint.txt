"""Prints the RGBA values for an image as text."""

== Synopsis ==

    {{{
    iprint [-H] [-C] [-F] [-x xoff] [-y yoff] [-w width] [-h height] ImageFile
    }}}
    Displays list of pixel values in RGBA order

    -H in hexadecimal

    -F in floating point 0. -> 1.

    -C in a compact form

== Description ==

    iprint displays the R, G, B and Alpha values for an image as a long
    list of ascii text. By default, all pixel values are displayed - one
    pixel per line, with the X and Y coordinates followed by the R, G, B
    and Alpha values. The range is 0 to 255.

== Options ==

    -x and -y:
        Specify x and y offsets to be applied to the picture, and -w and
        -h options specify width and height of a subframe, limiting what
        is displayed.
    -H:
        Indicates that the pixel values should be displayed in
        hexadecimal rather than the default decimal values.
    -F:
        Indicates that the pixel values should be displayed in floating
        point format in the range 0 to 1 rather than the default decimal
        values.
    -C:
        Indicates that the pixel values should be displayed in a compact
        form. Instead of each pixel on a separate line, each pixel is
        separated by two spaces, and each scanline starting a new line.
        This form is usable by other Houdini tools which utilize
        arrays.
    -A:
        Indicates that the pixel values should be displayed in the form
        of a Houdini ascii channel file with no headers and one row per
        scanline. Any combination of r,g,b and a may be given to select
        which of the red, green, blue or alpha pixel values should be
        output.
== Example ==

    {{{
    !iprint RenderedFrame.pic
    0    1: 255 255 255 255
    1    2: 255 204   0 255 [...638 more lines follow...]
    }}}
