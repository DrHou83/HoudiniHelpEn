= giges =

Converts iges geometry files - Import Only. It handles trimmed NURBS
patches and curves. This is enough to load most files exported from a 3D
graphics package.

== Usage ==

    {{{
    giges [-r] [-c] [-v] infile.{igs,iges} outfile.[b]geo 
    }}}
== Options ==

    `-r` :
        Reverse direction of trim loops. Sometimes trim loops in iges
        files will be specified in a direction opposite to the Houdini
        convention. This option reverses all of the trim loops so that
        they will agree with Houdini's convention (i.e. ccw means "keep
        inside").
    `-c` :
        Read the primitive colors defined in the IGES file.
    `-v` :
        Output verbose status messages to the standard output.
