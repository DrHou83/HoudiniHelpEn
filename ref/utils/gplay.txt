"""Geometry viewer."""

Allows you to view 3D geometry files in a Viewport similar to the one in
Houdini. You can rotate, tumble, zoom, and even render the viewed
geometry.

You can also display the Viewport Options dialog, which allows you to
optionally display hulls, point and vertex numbers, and normals, etc.

== Options ==

`-p`:
    Start up in playback mode.

`-P <<mode>>`:
    Set the playback mode (the mode should be one of `loop`, `once` or `zigzag`).

`-r <<fps>>`:
    Set the frames-per-second for realtime play.

`-R`:
    Turn on realtime play without specifying a rate.

`-u`:
    Don't sort filenames specified on the command line.

`-U`:
    Unpack geometry before displaying it.  This allows you to inspect attributes on packed geometry.
