"""Prints polygon file statistics."""

`ginfo` displays statistics about one or more polygon files.

The `-S`, `-i` and `-v` options will have significant performance
differences on large files.  For a 2.2 MB primitive file with nine million vertices:

{{{
#!sh
% time ginfo -S file.bgeo > /dev/null
0.04 seconds
% time ginfo -i file.bgeo > /dev/null
6.12 seconds
% time ginfo -v file.bgeo > /dev/null
12.52 seconds
}}}

== Options ==
    
`-S`:
    Prints a summary of information available in the file header
	rather than reading the entire geometry file.

`-i`:
    Check file integrity by parsing the file without creating any
    internal data structures.

`-v`:
    Fully load geometry from the file.

`-p`:
    List primitive types which are registered for the geometry library.

`-s`:
    Suppress output (the exit status will contain success).

`-u`:
    Disable pretty printing (i.e. 2048 instead of 2,048).

`-I`:
    List all intrinsic attributes.

`-P`:
    List registered primitives.

`-B`:
    Build legacy GB points (for memory debugging).

`-T`:
    Disable full topology information (for memory debugging).

`-M`:
    Show memory breakdown.

`-V`:
    Verbosity. Default is `0`. `-V 1` shows more intrinsic information.
    `-V 2` shows full intrinsics on full load (same as the `-v`
    option).
