"""Convert between Alembic and Houdini geometry."""

This program converts geometry files from one format to another. If a
level of detail is specified, all geometry will be converted to polygons
at the detail specified.

{{{
gconvert [options] infile outfile

When converting from Alembic to Houdini geometry:

`-p` object_path:
    A space separated list of objects in the Alembic file to convert.  The full path of objects should be given.  All children of specified nodes will also be converted.
`-o` object_pattern:
    A pattern used to match object names for conversion.
`-t` time:
    Extract geometry at this given time.
`-f` frame fps:
    Compute the time to extract by dividing the given frame by the fps.
`-l` load_mode:
        The load mode may be one of:
        - `abc`: Save geometry as Alembic Delayed Load primitives (default).
        - `houdini`: Save Houdini geometry.
        - `points`: Save Houdini point cloud.
        - `boxes`: Save Houdini geometry for the shape bounding boxes.

When converting from Houdini to Alembic, the options include:

`-F` faceset_mode:
        Determines how groups will be converted to face sets.  The faceset_mode should be one of:
        - `none`: No face sets will be created.
        - `partial`: Face sets will be created only for groups which contain at least one face (default).
        - `all`:  Face sets will be created for all groups, even if the group is empty.

`-O` output_format:
	Where output_format may be one of:
        - `hdf5`: Save Alembic using HDF5 format
        - `ogawa`: Save Alembic using Ogawa format (default)
        HDF5 is more compatible with older software but not as efficient as Ogawa.
