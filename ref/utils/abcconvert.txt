= abcconvert =

"""Convert between Alembic formats."""

This is a pre-compiled version of the AbcConvert example code that's included in the Alembic open source code.  It can be used to convert .abc files between HDF5 and Ogawa without any interpretation of the file (i.e. lossless).

{{{
abcconvert [-force] targetformat infile outfile 
}}}

You must specify either `-toOgawa` or `-toHDF` as the `targetformat`

If `-force` is not provided and `infile` happens to be the same type as the `targetFormat`, no conversion will be done and a message will be printed out.
