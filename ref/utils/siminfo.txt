"""Prints simulation cache file statistics."""

`siminfo` displays statistics about one or more DOPs simulation cache files.

== Options ==
    
`-n`:
    Specify a maximum number of characters to display for the names of data
    stored in the file. Setting this parameter can produce more legible
    output from this command since data names can be very long.

`-V`:
    Verbosity. Default is `0`, which only shows a high level summary of the
    file. This option is most useful to ensure that the file contents are
    valid. `-V 1` shows a list of all objects and relationships in the
    simulation. `-V 2` shows all objects, relationships, and a full hierarchy
    of all data attached to these objects and relationships. `-V 3` provides
    the highest level of verbosity which displays the full data hierarchy and
    all options available for each piece of data. This does not include full
    representations of geometry and volumes, but does include parameters set
    on forces, object state, and so on.
