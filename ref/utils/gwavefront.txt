"""Converts .obj files to/from Houdini format."""

Converts an `.obj` file to the other format or convert the other format
to an `.obj` file.

{{{
gwavefront [-l lod] [-u] [-t] inFile outFile 
}}}
inFile outFile:
    One of inFile/outFile has the extension .obj and is in Wavefront
    file format, the other file should be a format understood by the
    geometry library.
-l lod:
    Uniform level of detail for conversion to polygons. The default is
    1.0
-t:
    Force texture attribute to be attached to points.
-u:
    Force points to be unique. This helps with multiple texture
    coordinates per point.
The -t option is basically equivalent to the -u option as points will only be made unique if texture coordinates exist. This ensures
that the attribute will be correctly mapped

NOTE:
    When converting to `.poly` or `.bpoly` format, the -t option should
    be used. As well, normals are always attached per point, which means
    that the -u option should be used if there are different normals per
    position vertex in the `.obj`.
