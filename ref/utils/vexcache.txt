"""Query or modify the VEX compile cache."""

== Synopsis ==

{{{
vexcache [-h] [-v] [-c] [-r] [-m max_size] [-l max_log_size] [-p]
}}}

== Description ==

The VEX compiler is able to cache specialized VEX code in a cache.  The `vexcache` stand-alone application allows you to query or modify the behavior of this cache.

- The `-h` will show help for the command.

- The `-v` will increase verbosity of the command.

- The `-c` option will clear the VEX cache.

- The `-r` option will recompute the sizes and file counts in the cache.  This is
normally done automatically, but this option can be used to ensure the cache
counts are perfectly accurate.

- The `-m` option specifies the maximum size of the cache in MB.

- The `-l` option specifies the maximum size of the log file in MB.

- The `-p` option prints out information about the current configuration of the cache.
