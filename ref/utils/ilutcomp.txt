"""Generates a single lookup table (LUT) from from two LUTs."""

== Synopsis ==

{{{
ilutcomp [-i] [-p] [-q] srclut1 srclut2 outlut
}}}

where:

`-i`:
  Inverse builtins. Builtin LUTs (gamma, sRGB, REC709) normally convert from linear to non-linear space. `-i` reverses this so they convert from non-linear to linear
`-p`:
  Create a 3D prelut instead of compositing a 1D and 3D LUT `srclut1` must be a single linear 1D LUT, and `srclut2` must be a linear 3D LUT.

`-q`:
  Quiet. Don't print any messages.

== Description ==

`ilutcomp` produces a single LUT from two source LUTs. The order of the LUTs determines which is applied first. The input range of the first LUT will be the input range of the new LUT, and the output range of the second LUT will be the output range of the new LUT. If either LUT is log-sampled, the resulting LUT will be log-sampled.

If `-p` is specified, a 3D+prelut LUT will be created. In this case, the first LUT must be a single 1D LUT and the second LUT a 3D LUT. Both LUTs in a 3D+prelut are linear.

Several symbolic LUT filenames are supported.

sRGB:
        Use an sRGB LUT.
REC709:
        Use an REC709 LUT.
gamma=#:
        Generate a LUT with gamma of `#` (ie, gamma=2.2).

These will convert from linear. Use `-i` to convert to linear instead.
