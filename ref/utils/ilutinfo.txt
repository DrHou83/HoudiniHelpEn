"""Prints information about a lookup table (LUT) file."""

== Synopsis ==

{{{
ilutinfo lut_file [lut_file...]
}}}

== Description == 

Prints header information about a lookup LUT file, such as its type, the 
channels it affects, sampling type, etc.

Type:
        The general type of the LUT.

        1D:
                A curve-based lookup table. May affect R,G,B and/or A.
        3D:
                A cube-based lookup table (RGB only)
        3D+prelut:
                A cube-based lookup table with a single curve LUT which RGB is run though before the cube.

Size:
        The number of entries in the LUT. For 1D LUTs, this is the number of data 
        samples in each curve. For 3D LUTs, this is the cube size (number of RGB
        triplets will be size^3). For 3D+preluts, the 1D curve size and the 3D cube
        size is reported.

LUT Channels:
        For 1D LUTs, the number of curves and the channels they affect (R,G,B,A).

Sampling:
        Whether the LUT is linearly or logarithmically sampled. In a linear LUT,
        the samples have the same sampling interval. Logarithmic LUTs have short
        intervals near the low end of the LUT and longer intervals at the end.

Precision:
        Binary LUTs can be saved in full (32b floating point) or half (16b floating
        point precision). The latter sacrifices some precision for smaller file
        sizes (and texture sizes, when used as a display LUT).

Input Range:
        The color range which is modified by the LUT. Values outside this range
        are clamped to this range.

Output Range:
        The output color range produced by the LUT, given values in the input range.

Black/white:
        Defines what value black and white are, from the LUT's perspective. 
        Generally this is 0,1 (for floating point color), but could be 0,255 is the
        LUT was expressed in 8b fixed values.
