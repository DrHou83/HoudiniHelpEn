"""Reduces polygons in a file."""

greduce reduces the polygon count of an object while trying to keep the
general shape of the object. greduce can also be run in batch mode,
where no graphical interface appears and the conversion is performed
from the command line only.

The Open Triangulated and Open 4 sided File menu options allows you to
open the geometry with triangles or quadrilaterals as the polygon type
respectively.

NOTE:
    It is recommended that you use the percent reduction buttons for
    speedier operations with this tool. Files with many polygons may
    take a long time to reduce using the reduction factor and angle
    parameters.

{{{

{{{

This will start the tools interactive mode, where you can reduce the
object's polygon count using the sliders and controls provided.

There are two controls for determining the polygon reduction. These are
represented as sliders at the bottom of the window. The reduction factor
is the primary control. However, this should be used in conjunction with
a small increase in the angle factor (e.g. 5).

To simply remove planar polygons, set the reduction factor to a small
number and the angle factor to a small number (i.e. 0.001, 0.001).
Beneath the sliders are a set of buttons which can be used to reduce the
polygon count by differing degrees. For example, remove 10% of the
polygons. These controls are approximate and are usually good to plus or
minus 5%. In some cases, it will not be possible for the program to
remove a large number of polygons. In these cases, hitting 90% reduction
will result in a smaller percentage actually removed.

{{{
greduce [-v] [-t|-q] -r reduction_factor -a angle infile outfile 
}}}
This reduces the geometry using the reduction factor and angle factor
specified.

{{{
greduce [-v] [-t|-q] -p percentage [-a angle] infile outfile 
}}}
This reduces the polygon count by the percentage specified. The angle
does not have to be specified, though it can make a small difference in
the resulting geometry.

{{{
greduce -v -p 40 -a 10 teapot.bgeo reduced.bgeo 
}}}
This example will run the polygon reduction program in "batch" mode.
With the -v specified, the resulting statistics will be displayed.
Sample output from the above command might look like:

{{{
Used reduce = 0.151 and angle = 10 Reduced to 170 polygons. 40.9722% reduction 
}}}
{{{
greduce -v -r 0.08 -a 10 teapot.bgeo reduced.bgeo 
}}}
The above command will reduce the polygons in the teapot file using the
parameters specified. Again, the verbose option (-v) will cause some
statistics to be displayed when the program is finished. This output
will look something like:

{{{
Reduced to 193 polygons. 32.9861 % reduction 
}}}
== Options ==

    `-v` :
        Verbose option for batch mode versions
    `-t|-q` :
        Triangulate or make quadrilaterals out of the input file
    `-r` :
        Reduction factor (corresponds to upper slider in interactive
        version)
    `-a` :
        Angle of reduction (corresponds to lower slider in interactive
        version)
    `-p` :
        The amount, expressed as a percentage, of the original geometry
        to reduce.
