"""Sends an image to an mdisplay window."""

== Synopsis ==

    {{{
    imdisplay image 
    }}}
    or:

    {{{
    imdisplay width height format 
    }}}
== Description ==

    imdisplay copies an image to an mdisplay window (i.e. like mantra
    rendering to iplay). If an mdisplay window is already open, the same
    window will be used to display the image (unless the server has been
    disconnected).

    This allows things like COP render sequences render to a single
    iplay-like window. To use this, specify "md" instead of "ip" when
    specifying the output image name.

    The imdisplay program can also be used to allow other renderers (or
    other applications) to take advantage of the mdisplay capabilities.
