"""Scans an image for video-unsafe colors."""

== Synopsis ==

    {{{
    ihot [-b|-w] [-p] inimage outimage 
    }}}
    where:

    -b:
        Flag hot pixels with black.
    -w:
        Flag hot pixels with white.
    -p:
        Use pal video standards.
== Description ==

    This program scans an image for pixels with rgb values that will
    give "unsafe" values of chrominance or composite signal amplitude
    when encoded into an ntsc or pal. This happens for certain
    high-intensity and high-saturation colors that are rare in real
    scenes, but can be easily present in synthetic images.

    By default the offending pixels are made "safe" by reducing their
    intensity (luminance) while leaving hue and saturation the same. If
    one of the -b or -w options is specified, hot pixels are flagged so
    you can choose other colors.
