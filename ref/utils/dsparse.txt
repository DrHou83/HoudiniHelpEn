"""Parses and displays dialog scripts."""

{{{
dsparse dialog_script_name [initial dialog string] 
}}}

This application parses a dialog script and displays the dialog without
having to run Houdini. This can be used to quickly test dialog scripts
without the overhead of re-loading Houdini.

This program generates `.ui` files which are cached for future runs of
the application. When changing parameters, it's a good idea to remove
these `.ui` files to make sure that the dialogs are up to date. These
_.ui_ files are built in...

- `/usr/tmp/Dialogs/HDSParse` (on Unix)
- `C:/Documents and Settings/<<username>>/Local Settings/Temp/Dialogs/HDSParse` (on Windows)

...so for testing, it's usually a good idea to run:

{{{
rm -rf /usr/tmp/Dialogs/HDSParse
dsparse dialog_script_name
}}}
