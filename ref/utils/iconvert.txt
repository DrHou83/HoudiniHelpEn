"""Converts image formats."""

Converts an image of one type to another type.  The type is determined by
the extension on the file.

== Synopsis ==

{{{
iconvert [-d depth] [-n informat] [-t outformat] [-g (off|auto)] [-L <lut>] [-O <lut>] infile outfile [tag tagvalue] ...
}}}
    
== Description ==

Converts an image of one type to another type. The type is
determined by the extension on the file.

The `-d` option is used to specify the bit-depth of the output file.

* -d byte,char,8  = 8 bit unsigned int
* -d short,16     = 16 bit unsigned int
* -d half         = 16 bit floating point
* -d float        = 32 bit floating point

When the input format is ambiguous (i.e. reading from stdin), you can forcibly
specify the input format using the `-n` option.  The `-t` option can be used to
forcibly specify the output format (regardless of file extension).

The `-g` option controls whether gamma conversion is done when converting
formats.  For example, .exr files are typically in linear format while .jpg
files have a gamma applied.  The default value for this option is determined by
the environment variable `HOUDINI_AUTOCONVERT_IMAGE_FILES` and the expected
options are
* auto : perform gamma conversion if required
* off  : do not perform gamma correction

The `-L` option specifies the input cineon LUT, while the -O specifies the
output cineon LUT.

iconvert will now apply a gamma correction to color planes when converting
between formats of different types, if those formats have different colorspaces.
This can be disabled with the `-g off` parameter. 

By default tags are passed to the output image.  Tags may optionally be
prefixed with "in:" or "out:" to specify that the tag should be
associated with either the input or output image.
