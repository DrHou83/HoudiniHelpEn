== Synopsis ==

    {{{
    izmatte [-v] <rgbpic1> <zpic1> <rgbpic2> <zpic2>... <outrgbpic> <outzpic> 
    }}}
== Description ==

    izmatte composites pairs of images. Each pair is an rgba image and a
    Z image rendered from the same camera of the same scene. To
    calculate each pixel in the output image, the corresponding pixels
    of the input Z images are compared. The rgba of the nearest image is
    used. izmatte uses alpha coverage of the nearer images to determine
    how much of the farther images to contribute to the output pixel.

    The Z-images are expected to be in the 4-byte floating point format
    as output by the -Z option of mantra.

    izmatte is useful when a scene cannot be rendered fast enough with
    the available memory. The scenes are rendered separately and the
    user does not need to care about depth sorting objects for
    compositing. The animation can be decomposed into any convenient
    groups of objects.

    An inevitable property of the algorithm is that some subtle errors
    occur when mixing pixels with partial alpha coverage, but it appears
    barely noticeable.

    Both the rgb image and Z image need to be rendered in two calls to
    mantra. This will be simplified to one call soon, so the polygon
    data can be loaded only once.
