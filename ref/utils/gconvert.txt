"""Convert between Houdini polygon formats."""

Polygon files can be stored in three formats: `.poly`, `.bpoly` and
`.d`. pconvert converts between these formats. See the on-line manual
page.

This program converts geometry files from one format to another. If a
level of detail is specified, all geometry will be converted to polygons
at the detail specified
