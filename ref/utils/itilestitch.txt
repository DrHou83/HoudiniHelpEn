"""Assemble a series of image files with crop windows into a single image."""

== Synopsis ==

{{{
itilestitch <outimage> <infile> [<infile2> ...]
}}}

== Description ==

`itilestitch` creates a single output image by combining multiple input images.

All images must share the same resolution, plane composition, and data formats.  They should only differ in their visible/crop windows.

The output image will have the same resolution as the input images.

This command is useful to assemble a final image from mantra's tile based renders.
