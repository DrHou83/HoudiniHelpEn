"""Convert images from 10-bit Cineon format to an 8 bit format."""

== Synopsis ==

    {{{
    icineon [-F] [-g <<gamma>>] <<inimage>> <<outimage>>
    }}}
== Description ==

    icineon will convert images between 10 bit cineon format and any
    known 8 bit Houdini format (i.e..pic, `.rla`, `.tga`). icineon will
    work automatically since it is included in the `FBio` files.

    The icineon suffix `.cin` and `.kdk` is installed and the
    $HFS/houdini/FBio table recognizes `.cin` and `.kdk` images file
    names.

== Options ==

    `-F` :
        Flip the image in Y during conversion.
    `-g` :
        Used to specify a particular gamma correction to compensate for
        the varying brightness. If a cineon image is displayed by
        Houdini, Houdini will darken the image to correct for the gamma
        that is inherent in the original cineon file.

        The default gamma correction is 0.6 when converting from cineon
        to Houdini and the default is set to 1.67 when converting from
        Houdini to cineon.

    Since cineon files do not include alpha, icineon fills in the alpha
    channel with 1 when converting from cineon to Houdini. All alpha is
    lost when converting from Houdini to cineon.

== Examples ==

    To convert and flip a Houdini image file to a cineon image file:

    {{{
    icineon -F marble.pic marble.cin
    }}}
    To convert and gamma correct a cineon image file to Houdini format
    and output to screen:

    {{{
    icineon -g 0.8 block.kdk ip
    }}}
    To iplay an image of cineon format:

    {{{
    iplay image.cin 
    }}}
