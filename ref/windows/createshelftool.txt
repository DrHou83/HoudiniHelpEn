= Create Shelf Tool window =

When you drag multiple nodes to the shelf, Houdini will create a shelf item
that adds copies of the dragged nodes to the current network. These options
control how the nodes will be created.

[Include:optype#name]

[Include:optype#label]

[Include:optype#icon]

Houdini lets you automatically connect nodes to existing inputs and outputs
by right clicking them. Since this new shelf item will create multiple nodes
at once, it's ambiguous which of the nodes should be connected to the
input/output you clicked. The following pop-up menus let you choose which of
the dragged nodes to use in these cases.

Input Node:
	If you right click a node output and choose the new shelf item from the
	menu (meaning you want to add the nodes to that output), this node will
	be connected to the output.

Output Node:
    If you right click a node input and choose the new shelf item from the
	menu (meaning you want to add the nodes to that input), this node will
	be connected to the input.

TIP:
	You can edit additional options by right-clicking the shelf item and
	choosing __Edit tool__ after you create it.
