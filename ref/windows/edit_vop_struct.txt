"""Edits VOP struct data types."""

== Overview ==

This window allows you to create and edit defined VOP struct data types.
See [VOP structs|/vex/vop_structs] for more information on using structs in VOPs.

The left side of the window has a list of existing struct types.
The right side lets you edit the struct you select on the left.

== How to ==

:task:Add a new type:
    # Open the __Create__ menu and choose "Struct".
    # Use the controls on the right side to edit the struct (see below).

:task:Delete an existing type:
    Click the small [Icon:list_delete] delete icon to the right of the struct's name in the list.

:task:Rename an existing type:
    # Select the struct on the left.
    # Edit the __Name__ parameter on the right.

:task:Load definitions from a file:
    Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/import_library] Load Definitions icon above the struct list.
    The file should be a
    [JSON file like the files used to store the types|/vex/vop_structs#json].

== Controls ==

File:
    The definitions file the type is saved in.
    You can edit this and click __Apply__ to save the type to a different file.

Name:
    Internal name of the struct.
    It can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

Connector color:
    Turn this on and click the swatch to set a custom color for wires of this type.

Member list:
    Each row represents a member of the struct.
    Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/add] Add icon to add a member.
    Click the small [Icon:BUTTONS/list_delete] delete icon in the first cell to delete it.
    Click a type, name, or label cell to edit it.
    You can drag the first cell in a row to reorder the list.
    
    Type:
        The data type of the member.
        This can be a basic type such as integer or float,
        or another defined struct,
        or "struct" to allow _any_ struct to be assigned in this slot.

    Name:
        Internal name of the member.
        This name is used in the generated VEX code.
        It can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
    
    Label:
        Human-readable name for the member.
        This name is used in the user interface.
