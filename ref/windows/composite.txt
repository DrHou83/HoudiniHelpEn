#helpid: h.menu.settings.compositeproject

= Composite Project Settings window =

This window lets you change the default settings for compositing. Unlike
the __Compositing__ section of the [Houdini Preferences|/ref/windows/mainprefs#comp]
window, these settings only affect the current scene file.

You can set a COP node to "follow project settings" for various
parameters (like __Resolution__ and __Frame range__, which follow by
default). In this case, when you change the setting here, the node will
use the updated value. This lets you change pervasive settings, such as
pixel format, in once place instead of manually editing every node.
Conversely, you can have a COP override the project setting for a
parameter.

To make the current scene file's settings the defaults for all future
compositing projects, click __Save as defaults__.

Resolution:
    The default resolution for compositing.
Pixel Aspect Ratio:
    The ratio of pixel width to height. Values other that one give
    non-square pixels.
Pixel Format:
    Choose 8/16 bit integer or floating point. Higher bit depths allow
    more colors. Floating point allows greater resolution during color
    manipulations.
Pixel Black/White Points:
    The values corresponding to black (usually 0) and white (usually 255
    in an 8-bit format).
    
Enable Large Canvas:
    Enabling this checkbox maintains all of the information outside of the image frame. For example, if you were to translate an image to the left by 10 pixels and later blur it, the 10 pixels that are off screen are still used in the computation. Also, if another transform causes the pixels to be moved back into the frame, they would will be there. If this checkbox is turned off, the information is lost when it is pushed out of the image frame.

Frame Range:
    The default playback range for compositing.
    
Frame Rate:
    The default playback rate (in frames per second) for compositing.

Global Cook:
    Lets you work with scaled versions of processed images to save
    cooking time.

File Operators use the Project Resolution/Pixel Depth by Default:
    If these options are on, images brought into the scene by new File
    operators use the resolution/pixel format specified in this window
    instead of their native values.
    
File operators use the last entered filename:
    New file operators default to the last file chosen.
