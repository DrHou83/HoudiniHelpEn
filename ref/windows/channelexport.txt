= Export channels window =

This dialog lets you set up exports for CHOP channels track-by-track.

To access this window, click ((RMB)) a CHOP and select __Exporter - Set Scope__.

CHOP Filter:
    Regular expression to determine which node(s) will be show tracks in
    the lister.

    For example, `/ch/ch1/wave1` will show only the tracks in that
    specific CHOP. `*/wave1` will list all the tracks in all CHOPs named
    wave1.

    Use the left/right arrow buttons to the left to scroll through the
    filter history.

All Channels/Exported Channels/Non-Exported Channels:
    Which tracks/channels inside each CHOP will be shown.

    "All" shows every track.

    "Exported Channels" shows only channels which are successfully
    exported to some other OP in Houdini. This includes links created
    with drag and drop, this dialog, or with the export prefix.

    "Non-Exported" shows tracks which do not override anything.

Refresh:
    Reloads all the export states and CHOP channels, syncing them with
    the rest of Houdini.
Channel list:
    List of all the scoped CHOPs.

    Click the orange button next to a CHOP to set its export flag.

    Under the CHOP is a listing of all the channels. If the channel is
    overriding another parameter, the parameter appears in gray.

    Beside the name of the channel is a text box where you can enter the
    path of a parameter to override. For example, `/obj/model/tx` will
    make the channel override the model object's horizontal position.
    You can drag a parameter into this box to create a CHOP expression
    reference, or drag a channel into the right side to set up a channel
    mapping.

    NOTE:
        If a channel has a manual mapping, either from this dialog or
        from drag and drop, the channel will NOT be exported by the
        Export Prefix method.
