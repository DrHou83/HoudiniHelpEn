= Audio Panel =

The Audio Panel sets the audio volume, and lets you choose which CHOP
provides the audio waveform data for the animation timeline for lip
syncing. You can access the Audio Panel it by selecting it from the Windows drop-down menu or by pressing ((Alt + I)).

NOTE:
    This panel controls the audio that Houdini provides to the operating
    system. The operating system may do further processing or volume
    adjustment to the data before sending it to the speakers.

Audio output controls:
    Off:
        Do not play audio.
    Scrub:
        Audio plays when during playback and when you scrub on the
        timeline.
        
        You might want to disable 'Playback/Integer Frame Values' in
        the 'Global Animation Options'.
        
        Audio scrubbing is more precise when the scrubbing can change
        time in small steps.

        The options below the Timeline radio button control how audio
        plays when you scrub along the timeline.

        Repeat:
            When you hold the play head still while scrubbing, the audio
            will repeat around that frame.
            
        Sustain:
            Controls the length of audio played when repeating. Higher
            numbers give shorter bursts of audio. (30 means 1/30th of a
            second, 45 means 1/45th of a second).
        
        Rate:
            Controls the length of audio played around each frame you
            scrub to. Higher numbers give shorter bursts of audio (30
            means 1/30th of a second, 45 means 1/45th of a second).
    Realtime:
        Plays a CHOP whose __Time Slice__ option is on (forwards only).

        Audio Output Delay:
            The delay applied to the audio output.
            
    Test:
        Lets you play audio independent of the audio timeline.

        VCR Controls:
            These buttons are similar to the ones on the playbar. See [playbar|/anim/playbar] help for more information.
        
        On Change Rewind:
            Restarts the audio when a change is made.
            
Mono:
    Output audio on only one channel.
Tie:
    Lock the volumes of the left and right channels together (changing
    one changes the other). When this option is off, you can set the
    volumes of the left and right audio channels independently.
Meter:
    Turns on the live-updating VU meter.
VU Meter:
    Displays the current volume of CHOPs audio output. The green area
    represents output between -1 and +1. The red zone represents output
    outside -1 to +1, indicating the waveform is being clipped.
L and R:
    Control the volume of the left and right audio channels. When the
    __Tie__ checkbox is on, these sliders are locked together.
CHOP:
    Get the audio output from a channel operator (CHOP). Click the +
    icon to choose the CHOP from your network hierarchy.
File:
    Get the audio output from a sound file. Click the + icon to choose
    the file.
Audio Second ... is at Frame:
    When the audio source is __File__, you can use these options to sync
    the sound file to your animation. To start the output later in the
    sound file, increase the __Audio Second__ option. To start the
    output later in the animation, increase the __is at Frame__ option.

TIP:
    You can also use the [audiopanel HScript command|Cmd:audiopanel] to control audio output.
