#helpid: h.menu.tools.gallerymanager

= Gallery Manager window =

This window lets you view and edit gallery entries for any node type.

Gallery entries can specify various categories they belong to, and, 
in addition, they can also specify sub-categories using a slash delimiter
(see [save gallery entry dialog|savetogallery] for details).
The tree presented in the gallery manager window reflects this category
hierarchy.  By default, the tree nodes are sorted using a custom order, 
which is defined in a preferences.json file located in the gallery
search path. But, other sort orders are available in the ((RMB)) menu 
of the tree.

The preferences.json file lists the custom order in the "categoryOrder" for
the main categories, and in "subCategoryOrder" for sub categories. For example,
{{{
{
    "categoryOrder" : ["Generic", "Materials", "Volume", "Utility"],
    "subCategoryOrder" : {
	"Materials" : {
	    "categoryOrder" : ["Character", "Liquids", "Metal"]
	}
    }
}
}}}
