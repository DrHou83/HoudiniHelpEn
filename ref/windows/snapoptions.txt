#helpid: h.pane.gview.snapping

= Snap options window =

Click the snapping icon on the left side of the viewer pane and
choose __Multi-Snapping options__ to open the snap options window. The options in
this window control [snapping to geometry|/model/aids].

Move the sliders to assign a snapping priority to each type of element.
The cursor will snap to elements with a higher priority in preference to
elements with a lower priority.

NOTE:
    At the object (OBJ) level, the __Snap to Template__, __Guide
    Geometry__, and __Construction Plane__ options have no effect.
    
== Grid/Primitive/Point ==

Gravity:
    How many pixels you have to be from an element before it will
    attract.
Apply To:
    Whether to snap to features on Templates, Selectable Templates,
    Visible Objects, and/or X-Ray Geometry.
Occlusion:
    Prevent snapping to targets occluded by geometry.
Depth Snap:
    Snap to the XYZ location of the target geometry (point, edge,
    primitive, and so on). When this checkbox is off, Houdini projects
    the coordinates of a snap point onto the  [construction
    plane|/model/aids]. This lets you snap to reference
    geometry off the construction plane without leaving the construction
    plane.
Interior Snap:
    Snap to the center of the target geometry (point, edge, primitive, and 
    so on). The center of the geometry is determined using either the
    view direction or the normal direction. Interior snapping can only be 
    performed when depth snapping is enabled. 
View Based:
    View based interior snapping determines the center of the target geometry
    by choosing the average of the closest two points of intersection along 
    the viewing direction
Normal Based:
    Normal based interior snapping determines the center of the target geometry
    by choosing the average of the XYZ position of the target geometry and the
    first point of intersection along the normal of the target geometry.
Snap Consolidate:
    This option allows you to build primitives with shared points. For
    example, when creating a new polygon or curve, an added vertex will
    use an existing geometry point if you have snapped to it, and if
    Snap Consolidate in on.
    
Orient on Snap:    
    When you snap one object to another, normally the orientation of the object will remain the same and only its location will change. If this option is turned on, the object will rotate as determined by the following setting.

    Nearest Axis to Normal:
        Rotate so the closest major axis (x, y, z) points in the direction normal to the thing you are snapping to.
    Nearest Axes to Frame:
        Rotate so the closest two major axes (x, y, z) point in the directions normal to and tangent to the thing you are snapping to, respectively.
    Standard Axes to Frame:
        Rotate so the z axis and x axis point in the directions normal to and tangent to the thing you are snapping to, respectively.

Snap Priority:
    Drag the slider left to decrease an elementâ€™s priority, drag it
    right to increase its priority. Move a slider all the way too the
    left side to turn off snapping to that element.

    Primitive snapping does not include metaballs, but works on their
    hulls.

    In general, point-snapping should have a higher priority than edge
    snapping.

    Resets the snap settings.
    
Gravity/Apply To/Depth Snap/Snap Consolidate/Orient to Snap:
    Same as above.
