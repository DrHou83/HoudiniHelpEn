Color sliders:
    The color sliders let you choose colors using different component models: TMI (temperature, magenta, intensity), HSV (hue, saturation, value), and RGB (red, green, blue).

    TMI can be a convenient model for certain cinematic/photographic color operations. For example, in RGB you might increase red and decrease blue to warm the color, or increase blue and decrease red to cool it. In the TMI model, this is one slider, temperature. Intensity is also useful because it "brightens" or "dulls" a color while still retaining the color's "character".
