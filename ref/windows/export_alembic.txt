= Alembic Export Window =

== Overview ==

Alembic is an interchange file format used to move 3D animation data between
software packages.

# Choose __File > Export > Alembic__.
# Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser_file] Chooser button next to the __File__ field and pick the file you want to export to.
# Click __Export__ to perform the actual export.

NOTE:
    This export dialog works by creating a temporary [Alembic output driver|Node:out/alembic], setting the parameters, and running the export.  For more control, you may want to create an Output Driver and modify the parameters directly.

== Time interval options ==

Export With Take:
    Houdini take to export.
Valid Frame Range:
    Determines whether a static single frame or an animation segment is exported.
    
    Export Current Frame:
		Only the current frame will be exported. The resulting FBX file will contain a static scene only with no animation.

    Export Frame Range:
		A frame range will be exported, as determined by the __Start/End/Inc__ option below. The resulting FBX file will 
		contain one take of animation.
    
Start/End/Inc:
    Determines the start frame, end frame, and frame increment to be exported. 

== Source objects options ==

Export:
    Determines the nodes to export. Defaults to `*`, meaning all objects will be exported.
