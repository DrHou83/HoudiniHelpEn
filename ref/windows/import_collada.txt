== Options ==

Filter options:
    Only import certain types of data from the file.
    
Geometry options menu:
    The menu controls how to translate units in the COLLADA file.
    
    - *Scale to Houdini unit length* -- Use the units specified in the file and the unit size specified in Houdini to import geometry at the "proper" scale.
    
        For example, if the file has a point at (3, 0, 0) and the COLLADA unit length is 1 cm, and the Houdini unit length is 1 meter (the default), then the point is imported at (.03, 0, 0).
    
    - *Do not scale* -- Use the literal values in the file as Houdini units without doing any translation.
    
        For example, if the file has a point at (3, 0, 0), then the point is imported at (3, 0, 0), regardless of unit lengths.
    
    - *Scale to custom unit length* -- Set an explicit Houdini unit size to use for COLLADA units.
    
TIP:
    To set the real-world size of Houdini units, choose __Edit > Preferences > Hip File Options__.
    
Lock geometry:
    When this option is _on_, the [File node|Node:sop/file] Houdini creates loads the geometry and saves it with the Houdini `.hip` file, so the original file is no longer necessary. When this option is _off_, the File node only stores the reference to the original file.
