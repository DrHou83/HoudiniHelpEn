FPS:
    Frames Per Second sets the rate for animation playback when Real
    Time playback is enabled. You generally want to set the FPS for your
    animation only once, and do so before you begin animating anything
    at all. This is because when you change the FPS, the time of the
    last [keyframe|/anim/basics] will not match the new animation length. If you want
    to modify your animation timing, you must do so explicitly.

    The FPS rate for NTSC video is 30, for PAL video, it is 25, and for
    Film, it is 24.

    Production Tip: If you made a mistake, you can use a Field cop with
    a Pushup / Pulldown operation to fix a sequence of rendered-out
    images and convert them to a different FPS after the fact.

Start / End:
    The Start field displays the starting frame number of the animation
    sequence. By default, it contains a value of one. 

    The End field displays the final frame number of the animation
    sequence. 

Snap Keys:
    Snaps all keys to integer frame boundaries. This does the equivalent
    of `chround -a`.
    
Restrict playback range to Start and End frames:
    If this option in turned on, you will only be able to set time frames within the start and end range. For example, if the range is 1-240 and you try to set the [playbar|/anim/playbar] to -43, it will fail. Turning this checkbox off allows you to set the time frame to any value.

Show Range Slider:
    If this option is turned on, the slider widget underneath the [playbar|/anim/playbar] for visually manipulating the playback range is displayed.
    
Show Audio:
    Overlays the current audio track on the [playbar|/anim/playbar] so you can see audio wave.
    
Show Ticks:
    If this option is turned on, the [playbar|/anim/playbar] will show ticks representing the frame numbers.
    
Show Keys:
    If this option is turned on, the [keyframes|/anim/basics] in current objects show up as green marks on the [playbar|/anim/playbar].
    
Audio Wave Scale:
    Allows adjustment of the audio height, when shown on the [playbar|/anim/playbar].

Integer Frame Values:
    Houdini works with floating-point frame values ( `$FF` ). When
    enableref_win_globanimoptsd, this option confines the display of
    frame values to integers ( `$F` ). When disabled, Houdini allows you
    to set the current time to any value, even a fractional time that
    does not lie exactly on an exact frame number.

Step:
    The size of a single increment in frame values. For example,
    entering a value of 2 here plays every second frame.

Realtime Playback:
    Enables realtime playback on the [playbar|/anim/playbar]. To control the
    behavior of the realtime toggle, there are two options.
   
    Maintain realtime playback, possibly skipping frames:
        This option is not recommended for playback of particle
        simulations, which will still have to compute any skipped
        frames.

    Play every frame, but never faster than FPS:
        This option is better suited for playback of particle
        simulations.
