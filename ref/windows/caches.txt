= Cache manager window =

This window lets you view, edit the current size and maximum size of,
and clear the major caches in Houdini. To open the cache manager window,
choose __Window > Cache Manager__.

Edit the text boxes to set the maximum or current size of the caches. The
minimum size shows the amount of data currently locked in the cache (data which
cannot currently be removed, possibly because it is in use).
Reducing the current size will remove some data from the cache to accomodate the
new size and reflect the new current size after the data is removed.
Reducing the maximum size may also remove some data from the cache if the new
value is less than the current size.
