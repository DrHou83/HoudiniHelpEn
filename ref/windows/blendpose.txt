= BlendPose Tool Dialog =

The BlendPose Tool Dialog sets up relationships between different
driver and target parameters for animation purposes.

== Workflow ==

    The procedure below outlines the basic workflow. See the
    [Tasks|#ref_blendpose_tool_dialog_tasks]  section below for details
    on accomplishing each step.

    steps>>
        # Ensure driver and target parameter selection is correct.
          Change the selection if needed.

        # Modify driver and target parameter values and Add poses.

        # Repeat adding poses. In between, verify that the relationship
          is as desired by changing the driver parameter values.
          Previously added poses can be modified until the satisfied.

== Interface ==

    Pose:
        This indicates the current pose number. These are in the same
        sequence that the poses were added. This can be changed at any
        time to go to a specific pose. It is accomplished by setting the
        current parameter values to the previously saved pose values.
        Note that the order in which the poses were added do not matter.
    Next/Prev Pose:
        This allows one to browse the poses one at a time, stepping
        through them sequentially. If it goes past the first or last
        pose, then the pose number will wrap to the other size.
    Add:
        This takes a snapshot of the driver and target parameter
        values, and adds a new pose using them. Note that the order in
        which the poses are added do not matter.
    Update:
        This takes a snapshot of the driver and target parameter
        values, updating them to pose number currently specified.
    Remove:
        This removes the pose currently specified by the Pose number.
    Blend:
        This shows the current status of the BlendPose. When inactive,
        the target parameters may be freely modified. When active, the
        target parameters are controlled by the driver parameters.

        The blend is automatically enabled whenever a pose is added (and
        there is already an existing pose). It is automatically disabled
        whenever a node containing a driver parameter is selected.

    BlendPose CHOP:
        This specifies the node path of the BlendPose CHOP to use. If
        it doesn't exist yet, then it will be created the first time a
        pose is added. This CHOP overrides the driver parameters.
    Delete BlendPose (Icon):
        This deletes the currently specified BlendPose CHOP and all
        associated CHOPs. This removes the relationship that was added.
    Modify Target and Driver Selection..:
        This opens a new dialog from which the target and driver
        selections can be modified. This should be carefully done since
        removing parameters cause it to lose any previously added pose
        information, possibly causing different interpolation results.
        It is best that the selection is modified before adding any
        poses.
