= Display options (image view) =

In a compositing viewer pane, open the right side toolbar and click [Icon:BUTTONS/chooser] Display Options or press ((D)) to open the Display Options window.

In [MPlay|/mplay/], choose __Settings > Display Options__.

== Display tab ==

Auto mipmap images:
    Generates mipmaps on demand when the image is zoomed more
    than 3x. This may cause a slight delay during scaling as
    Houdini generates the mipmap.

Pop window when rendering images:
    Brings [MPlay|/mplay/] to the front when a render begins.
    
Render over previous image:
    When this option is turned on, rendering to [MPlay|/mplay/] will copy the previous image onto the new image as a background so that slight changes can be compared as the new image renders.
        
Fast Pixel Aspect Ratio Display:
    Images with pixel aspects not equal to one are stretched (>1) or squashed (<1) to approximate the image on hardware devices with non-square pixels. If this option is turned on, a simple hardware scale is used. If off, a slower but more accurate software filter is applied.

Show Borders of Currently Working Tiles:
    Shows the currently rendering/cooking tile(s) by drawing a corner box at its location.

== Viewport tab ==

Multi node display:
    Split views/single view.
    
Layout horizontally first, then vertically:
    When on, adds images to viewports horizontally first, when
    the viewport has multiple rows/columns. When off, adds
    images vertically first.
    
Show all viewports always:
    Keeps all viewports visible, even if whole rows or columns
    of viewports are empty. When off, the view dynamically
    adapts the viewport layout to the number of images
    available.
    
Default viewport layout:
    Specifies the initial layout of viewports, from 1x1 to 4x4.
    
Display viewport information:
    Controls the amount of information shown in viewports.
    __Minimal__ shows only the name, __Verbose__ shows all
    information available.
    
Image guide:
    See  [image guide file|/composite/image_guide].
    
Stereo Display Mode:
    Allows you to choose the display mode of stereo images in MPlay. You can choose between Anaglyph, Horizontal Interlace, or Horizontal Interlace (Reverse). 
    
    NOTE:
        You can use passive polarization glasses to view the images in horizontal interlace mode.
    
== Background tab == (cop_bg)

The viewer always stretches the background image to fit the size
of the currently displayed image. If the aspect ratio of the
background image and the current image do not match, you will
get distortion of the background image.

Filename:
    Choose the file to use as the background image.
Use Res:
    Manually specify a resolution to use for the background
    image instead of using the natural size of the image.
Foreground images are pre-multiplied:
    Most rendered images are pre-multiplied, which means that
    the color has already been multiplied by the alpha plane.

    However, if you place an arbitrary alpha plane without
    running it through a [Premultiply
    COP|Node:cop2/premultiply], the resulting image is not
    pre-multiplied, and you must turn off this option or your
    transparency will be wrong.

    For example: place a [File COP|Node:cop2/file], append a
    [Shape COP|Node:cop2/shape] and have it replace the Alpha
    plane with a star shape - then enable transparency. You'll
    need to turn off __Foreground Images are Premultiplied__ to
    see the proper image.

Background color:
    Background color of the image viewer, default is black.
    Click the color swatch to display a color picker.
    
== Correction tab ==

Display LUT:
    Choose a LUT file to apply to the images.
Inspect LUT:
    When inspecting, run raw values of the image backwards
    through the LUT file to produce the original values (Cineon
    values).
Default display gamma:
    The default gamma applied to all images. You can
    interactively change gamma using the color correction
    controls.
Gamma correct planes:
    The names of planes the viewer should gamma correct.
    Normally, this is just the color plane (`C`).
Gamma correct background color and image:
    Whether to apply the gamma correction to the viewport background
    color and the background image. 
Apply Brightness/Contrast before LUT:
    If on, the brightness/contrast (and black/white) controls in the correction
    toolbar are applied to the color before the LUT is applied. Otherwise, they
    are applied afterward. Gamma is always applied last.
    
== Handles tab ==

Render with smooth lines:
    Anti-aliases handle and guide lines.
Render with alpha blending:
    Makes handle and guide lines slightly transparent.
Handle color:
    The default color for handles and guide lines. Click the
    color swatch to show a color picker.
Handle pick size:
    The size of the handle's clickable area, in pixels. Larger
    values make the handles easier to grab.
Handles/output follow:
    Current Node(s), Current/Display, Current Node.
    
== Memory tab ==

Limit viewer memory usage:
    Limits the amount of cached image data to the __Image cache
    size__.
Memory Usage:
    Dictates how much memory [MPlay|/mplay/] will use to cache images for playback in Mb.
Clear images from memory:
    Flushes the image cache, freeing all memory except the
    memory used by the currently displayed image(s).
