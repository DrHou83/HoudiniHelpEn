            window to the actual desks.

        Show Hidden Files:
            You have the option of hiding desktops, which cause them to disappear from the desktop menu and from the desktop manager. Turning this option on allows you to see the hidden files.

        Show All Files:
            If Houdini's default desktop files are overridden by files
            of the same name in the users _$HOME/houdini_ directory,
            then only the files in use are displayed, and the default
            ones are not displayed. When this option is enabled, all the
            files are shown, even if they are not actually in use,
            because they are overridden. This can be confirmed by
            clicking on the Info pop-up.

        Auto Save Changes:
            When enabled, changes to desktops are automatically saved to
            the relevant desktop files without having to explicitly save
            them.

    Info button:

        `$HFS` load for all users of this copy of Houdini. Desktops
        under `$HOME` load only for you. Desktops under `$HIP` load only
        for the current scene.
