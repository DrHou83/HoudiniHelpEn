Show sequences as one entry:
    Displays sequences of files as a single entry. When the file dialog is opened to filter images, an additional menu appears which changes how the image sequence is generated from a numbered filename:

    Frame Range:
        A basic frame range, start to end frame with an optional frame step. The number is replaced by `$F` when collapsing the sequence, possibly with a padding digit (`$F4`).

    UDIM:
        UDIM texture sequence starting at 1001 for tiled textures. U and V are determined from the frame number, with U ranging from 1-10 and V incrementing for each 10. Frame 1001 is considered (0,0). The number is replaced by `%(UDIM)d` when collapsing the sequence.

    UV Tile:
        UV Tile texture sequence with two numbers determining the U and V. The first number is replaced by `%(U)d` and the second by `%(V)d` when collapsing the sequence.

File:
    The name of the file to load/save.

Show files matching:
    Allows you to narrow search results by specifying the extension of the file.
    
NOTE:
        You can click ((RMB)) in the dialog to turn on __Show Images__ and __Show Hidden Files__.
