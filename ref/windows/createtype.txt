To [create a digital asset|/assets/create]  from a subnet, press
((RMB)) on the subnet's node tile in the [network
editor|/ref/panes/network]  and choose __Create Digital
Asset__. This turns the subnet into a new operator type you can reuse.

After you create an asset, you can edit most of its settings by
pressing ((RMB)) on an asset instance and choosing __Type
Properties__ to open the [type properties window|/ref/windows/optype].

You can create a custom VOP from SHOPs, VOP networks, or any other
VEX-based operator.

When you create a digital asset from a VOP network, the type of
asset created depends on the type of VOP network. Most of the
options required to create the new operator type are gathered from
the VOP network.

Operator Name:
    Internal name of the operator. This must be unique across all the
    scene files you want to use this asset in, and is very difficult to
    change. You should use some kind of naming convention to ensure
    uniqueness.

    The name must start with a letter, and can contain letters, numbers,
    and underscores (`_`).

Operator Label:
    The human-readable name of the operator, which appears in the
    Houdini user interface (including the [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu].
    This should be relatively short (two to four words) but as
    descriptive as possible.
    
Minimum Inputs:
    The minimum number of inputs an instance of this operator must have
    to be considered valid. Set this to `0` if the operator is not
    _required_ to have an input connected.
    
Maximum Inputs:
    The maximum number of inputs an instance of this operator will
    accept. The default value is the current number of inputs to the
    subnet you are creating the new digital asset from.
    
Save to Library:
    Location of the operator type library (HDA) file to save the new
    asset into.

    While a single `.hda` file can contain multiple assets, in general
    you should save each digital asset in its own `.hda` file and name
    the `.hda` file after the asset's internal name. This makes it
    easier to manage assets, libraries, and dependencies in a pipeline.

    If you enter the word `Embedded` instead of a library name, the
    asset definition will be embedded in the scene file instead of saved
    into a `.hda` file.

Install Library to:
    After the digital asset's definition is created it needs to be
    _installed_ to be available in Houdini. This menu lets you choose
    the scope in which the library will be available:

    * For the current hip file only.

    * For you only (HOME).

    * For the current project (JOB).

    * Anywhere else in your HOUDINI_PATH.

    (If you choose a directory in your path, the HDA is not copied to
    the specified location. Instead Houdini adds a reference to the HDA
    to the OPLibraries file there.)
