This window displays a specific context view depending on the selected node. 

For example, the context view for an object is the [scene view|/ref/views/3dview], the context view for an output driver is the [render scheduler|/ref/panes/renderscheduler], the context view for a shader is the [shader view|/ref/panes/shaderview] etc.

You can access this view by clicking the [Icon:BUTTONS/new_tab] new tab icon in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network] and selecting __New Pane Tab Type > Context View__. You can also change an existing pane to a context view pane by clicking ((RMB)) on an existing pane and selecting __Context View__.
