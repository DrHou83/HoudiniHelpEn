= Geometry Spreadsheet pane =

Selected:
    View all or only selected geometry.
Point / Primitive Attributes:
    Choose whether to view/edit point or primitive attributes.
Attributes:
    Show or hide all attributes or switch between existing attributes.
Geo Select Button:
    For both SOP and POP viewing, a Geo-Selection button is provided.
    Clicking the right mouse ( ((RMB))) brings up a menu where the
    Selection Rule can be specified (just like the Selection Rules in
    the regular viewers' Select state). This menu also includes a
    checkbox labeled Auto. To use it, select regions in the spreadsheet
    the usual way (dragging the mouse to create a rectangular region).
    Only the rows are relevant to the geometry selection because they
    represent the points/primitives. If Auto is enabled, the geometry
    selection will be transferred immediately after you release the
    mouse button for the rectangular region. (The points/primitives are
    added/removed/toggled/replaced depending on the Selection Rule). If
    Auto is not enabled, you have to press the Geo Selection button with
    the _left_ mouse ( ((LMB))) button to apply the selection.

Viewing POPnets:
    When viewing a POP network in the spreadsheet, the path will always
    only display "/popnet1" or whatever the name of the POPNET node is.
    Basically, you're viewing the POPNET, and implicitly you're seeing
    the output of the cook POP. The browser won't allow you to select a
    specific POP node to view.

POP Reset Button:
    (Only available when viewing a POP spreadsheet) Jump to the first
    frame of the range.
