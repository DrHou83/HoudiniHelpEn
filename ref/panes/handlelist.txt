== Manipulator list ==

    When you  [make a manipulator persistent|/basics/handles] , it
    appears in the bottom list. The order of the bottom list controls
    the order of the persistent handle on/off icons in the selection
    toolbar on the left side of the viewer pane.

    E:
        Lets you hide or show the manipulator. When this flag is blue,
        the manipulator is visible. When this flag is off, the handle
        will not appear in the viewport, and its icon will not appear on
        the left side of the viewport unless you are using the operator
        which created the handle.

    P:
        Manipulator is visible when viewing a parent network of the node
        that created it. For example, if you turn off the P flag of a
        handle on a SOP, that manipulator will not be visible in an
        Object viewport.
    C:
        Manipulator is visible when viewing a Child network of the node
        that created it. For example, if you turn off the C flag for a
        handle of an Object, that manipulator will not be visible in a
        SOP viewport.
    S:
        Manipulator is visible when viewing Sibling networks of the node
        that created it. For example, if you turn off the S flag of a
        handle on a SOP, that manipulator will not be visible in the SOP
        viewport of a different Object.
    NOTE:
        Currently, the P, C, and S flags are only used by SOP and Object
        manipulators.
