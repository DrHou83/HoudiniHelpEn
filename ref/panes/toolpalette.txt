= Tool Palette =

The tool palette is a side bar in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network] that lists all of the shelf tools and gallery entries that are relevant in the current network type.

== Display options ==

The tool palette can display only tools, only gallery entries, or both. By
default it displays both, but this can be configures in the Contents menu by clicking the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu and choosing either __Both Tools and Galleries__, __Only Tools__, or __Only Galleries__.


The shelf tools and gallery entries are shown as leaves of a tree whose branches are the categories to which the tool or the entry
belong. You can see these categories in the tool/gallery editors by clicking ((RMB)) on the leaf representing the tool/gallery entry, and choosing __Edit__. In the gallery entry editor, look for the __Categories__ field, and in the shelf tool editor, look for the __TAB Submenu Path__ on the __Context__ tab.

NOTE:
    Gallery entries allow only a single level of category tree branch, whereas the shelf tools can specify nested branches separated by a slash '/'. Although, usually the tools specify only one level.

== Opening and closing the tool palette ==

There are several ways you can open/close the tool palette. You can use any of the following methods.

* Click the __Show/Hide tool palette controls__ button.

* Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network], then choose __Viewing Controls__ and enable or disable the __Show Tool Palette__ option.
    
    Similarly, you can click ((RMB)) in in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network], then choose __Viewing Controls__ and enable or disable the __Show Tool Palette__ option.

* In the [network editor|/ref/panes/network], press ((D)) to open the [Network Editor Display Options|/ref/windows/network_display_opts] dialog. On the Common tab you can toggle the __Show Tool Palette__ on and off.

* Use the `neteditor` hscript command with -k and -K option.


== Creating new gallery/tool categories ==

Houdini builds the tree branches based on the categories of the gallery entries and shelf tools. This means that there are no empty branches since all branches are specified by tools and galleries. However, you can create a new empty category.

* Click on the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu and selecting either __New Gallery Category__ or __New Tool Category__. 

* Enter a name for the new category in the dialog box. After accepting, this category will show up in the tree. 

* Drag node (or other entity) and drop it into the newly created category.

    NOTE:
        If you edit a gallery entry or a tool and you add a new category in the editor, Houdini will create that branch automatically and the brach will contain the entry or the tool.

Dragging a node and dropping it onto the category creates a new gallery entry or a new tool. When the new gallery entry is instantiated or the tool is invoked, they will recreate an exact copy of the dropped node. You can select several nodes and drop them on the palette. This will either create a single shelf tool that builds all selected nodes, or it will create several gallery entries, one for each dropped node.

The main purpose of the tool palette is to provide a way of creating nodes much like the [tab menu|/basics/tabmenu] does. Gallery entries represent operator nodes with specific values of the parameters (and their contents, if they are subnets), and the shelf tools are scripts that instantiate nodes and set their parameters. The end effect for both galleries and shelf tools is an instantiated node or nodes.

== Searching ==

=== Filter ===

The tool palette provides a few ways to narrow down the number of gallery
entries and shelf tools in the tree. A simple way to search is to use the __Filter__ field at the bottom of the tree to search for the items that match a specific pattern. 

=== Type-Ahead Search ===

You can also search and instantiate nodes in the tool palette using the
type-ahead search. You can enable or disable it in the [Icon:BUTTONS/gear] gear menu by toggling the __Type-Ahead Search__ checkbox. When it is enabled, the tree hotkeys are disabled and a quick search is performed you type each letter. 

NOTE:
    The mouse must be over the tool palette for the type-ahead to work.

Once you type a few letters in the type-ahead mode and the entry you are looking for is selected and highlighted, you can press ((Enter)) to instantiate it. This will create the node and will reset the type-ahead search string. You can also use arrows to navigate the type-ahead search results or double-click the entries to select them. Pressing ((Esc)) clears the type-ahead string.

=== Keywords ===

Another way to search is by using the menu in the upper toolbar that lists keywords. Gallery entries and shelf tools subscribe to a category using keywords found in their editors. 

    NOTE: You can see the __Keywords__ by clicking ((RMB)) on tool or gallery entry and selecting __Edit__.

After selecting an entry in the keyword menu, only entities that match 
the keyword will show up in the tree. Selecting __All__ in the keywords menu
will show all the entities again.
