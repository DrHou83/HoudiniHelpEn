= Light linker pane =

NOTE:
    In Houdini 13 and later, use of the light linker is discouraged in favor of the [light bank|/render/lightbank].

== Overview ==

The light linker lets you manage links between various nodes.

The light linker lets you link lights to objects to control which lights
illuminate which objects (__Light Mask__), which objects cast shadows from
which lights (__Shadow Mask__), and which objects are reflected in other
objects (__Reflection Mask__).

You can work by choosing which objects are lit by a light
(__Light-Centric__), or by choosing which lights light an object
(__Object-Centric__). For reflections, you can choose __Reflector-Centric__ or __Reflection-Centric__.

The pane consists of two subpanes the contents of which are determined
by the __Link type__ and __Mode__ settings. Each of these subpanes
contains a hierarchical display of nodes, [groups|/basics/bundles]  and
[bundles|/basics/bundles] . Links are created by first selecting one or
more items in the left (source) subpane and then selecting one or more
items in the right (target) subpane.

== How to ==

By default, all lights cast light on all objects, and all objects cast shadows from all lights (if they have [shadows turned on|/render/lights#enabling-and-disabling-shadows]). However, this is often not what you want, either because it's inefficient, or because you want to use common but technically non-realistic techniques such as character-specific lights.

You can use _light linking_ to set up specific relationships, so that an object only receives light from certain lights, and/or only casts shadows from certain lights.

You can link lights and shadows interactively using the [Light Linker pane|/ref/panes/linker], individually for each object and light directly in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms], or by specifying [categories|#categories].

:task:Open the light linker pane:
    Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/new_tab] new tab icon in the [network editor|/ref/panes/network] and selecting __New Pane Tab Type > Light Linker__. You can also change an existing pane to a light linker pane by clicking ((RMB)) on an existing pane and choosing __Light Linker__.

:task:Illuminate objects:
    # Choose Light Mask from the __Link Type__ drop-down menu.
    # Choose a mode from the __Mode__ drop-down menu.
    # Select the lights from the __Light Sources__ pane.
    # Select the objects to light from the __Lit Objects__ pane.
    
    *or*
    
    On the __Render__ tab of an object, set the __Light Mask__ on the __Shading__ sub-tab in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] to determine which lights will illuminate your object.
    
:task:Cast shadows from objects:
    # Choose Shadow Mask from the __Link Type__ drop-down menu.
    # Choose a mode from the __Mode__ drop-down menu.
    # Select the lights from the __Light Sources__ pane.
    # Select the objects which will cast shadows from the __Shadow Casters__ pane.
    
    *or*
    
    On the __Shadows__ tab of a light, choose the __Shadow Type__ from the drop-down menu (The default is No Shadows). Set the __Shadow Mask__ to determine which objects will cast shadows from your [light|lights].
        
:task:Reflect objects in other objects:
    # Choose Reflection Mask from the __Link Type__ drop-down menu.
    # Choose a mode from the __Mode__ drop-down menu.
    # Select the objects that are reflected from the __Reflection Sources__ pane.
    # Select the objects to reflect from the __Reflector Objects__ pane.
    
    *or*
    
    On the __Render__ tab of an object, set the __Reflection Mask__ on the __Shading__ tab in the [parameter editor|/ref/panes/parms] to determine which objects will be reflected by your object.

:task:Set up the link editor:
    # Choose the __Link type__ and __Mode__.

    # You can optionally filter the items using the __Filter__
      field.

:task:Link source items to target items:
    * Choose the source of the link in the left subpane. The right
      subpane shows all possible link targets, with the currently
      linked items highlighted. Select items in the right subpane to
      link them to the source item in left subpane.

      The link editor always reflects the current state of the scene
      file. Linked items are blue in the target list. Partially
      linked items are white.

    * Use the __Select__ field to control which items are selected
      in the target list with a pattern. Enter a pattern in the
      field and click + to add select any matches, - to deselect any
      matches, or = to select _only_ the matches.

      The `@<<bundle_name>> ` pattern will match the contents of a
      [bundle|/basics/bundles] , not the bundle itself. To match the
      bundle, use `@@<<bundle_name>> ` instead.

:task:See the parameter values being controlled by the link:
    * Move the mouse over the appropriate sub-pane, press ((Ctrl +
      RMB)) and choose __Show Spreadsheet__, or press ((W)). Only
      the subpane whose items contain the parameter being affected
      can show this spreadsheet. This will be the subpane displaying
      the lit objects when light masking, light sources when shadow
      masking, and reflector objects when reflection masking.

TIP:
    A quick way to add a node to a group or bundle is to drag it onto
    the corresponding tree node.

TIP:
    The cells in the spreadsheet column can be edited and multiple cells
    can be selected by holding ((Space)) and either clicking or
    dragging.

TIP:
    Channel references are followed when setting mask parameters making
    it possible to link objects embedded in locked assets.

== Toolbar buttons ==

Export view camera (camera icon):
    When this button is on, when you select a light in the source
    tree, the 3D viewer will automatically look down the light.

Read-only target selection (lock icon):
    When this button is on, you cannot select or deselect link
    targets.
        
== Select toolbar ==

[Icon:BUTTONS/equal]:
    Sets the selection to items that match the value in the Select field.

[Icon:BUTTONS/plus]:
    Adds items that match the value in the Select field to the current selection.
    
[Icon:BUTTONS/remove]:
    Removes items that match the value in the Select field from the current selection.
        
== Pane menu entries ==

Linker:
    Read-only target selection:
        When this button is on, you cannot select or deselect link
        targets.
    Export source as view camera:
        When this button is on, when you select a light in the
        source tree, the 3D viewer will automatically look down the
        light.
View:
    Source tree spreadsheet:
        When this toggle is on, the left subpane will contain a
        column displaying the parameters being modified (if
        appropriate).
    Target tree spreadsheet:
        When this toggle is on, the right subpane will contain a
        column displaying the parameters being modified (if
        appropriate).
    Expose linked target nodes:
        When this toggle is on, selecting items in the left subpane
        will cause the currently linked items in the right subpane
        to be exposed, expanding parent items as necessary.

== Troubleshooting ==

I can't select items in the target list:
    Possible causes and solutions:
    
    * The read-only button is on.
        Make sure the lock button above the right/target list is off (the button is bright yellow when it's on).
    
    * The parent is a bundle or a group.
        You cannot individually link a member of a bundle or a group using the contents of that bundle or group in the tree. This is by design. You will need to find the node in the operator hierarchy in order to link it.

I can't see my group or bundle:
    * The group or bundle is not empty, but contains no operators of the expected type. The linker will display empty groups or bundles to allow linking before populating them. However, once a group or bundle is non-empty, the linker attempts to reduce the clutter in the subpanes.
        
        Either add an operator of the expected type to the group or bundle, or create a new one.
