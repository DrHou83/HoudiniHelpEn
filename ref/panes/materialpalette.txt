"""Lets you assign materials to objects and primitives interactively."""

== Overview ==

The material palette is split into two sides.

- The left side shows the contents of _gallery files_ on disk. Gallery files store instances of a node with various settings. Houdini ships with several galleries containing pre-made materials such as Burlap and Plastic. The settings for this tree view are the same as for [the gallery manager|/ref/windows/gallerymanager].

- The right side shows the [materials|/shade/] and shaders that exist in the scene. You may have loaded them from the gallery or you may have created them from scratch. Once you load a material from the gallery, you can customize it by changing its settings and contents, so materials in the scene may not match the materials in the gallery.

== How to == (howto)

:task:Load a material into the scene:
    - Drag the material from the gallery to the right side of the material palette.
        
        or
        
    - Click the material in the gallery and then click the [Icon:BUTTONS/move_to_right] move over button.
        
    TIP:
        You can load several copies of the same material into the scene and customize them to look slightly different.

:task:Assign a material to a geometry object:
    Do any of the following:
        
    - Drag an on-disk material from the gallery onto the object in the scene view. This loads a copy of the material into the scene.
        
    - Drag a scene material from the right side onto the object in the scene view.
        
    - Select the object, select a scene material, then click __Assign__ at the top of the material palette.
        
:task:Assign a material to the selected faces:
    [Select the faces|/basics/select], select a scene material, then click __Assign__ at the top of the material palette.
        
    This appends a [Material surface node|Node:sop/material] inside the object's surface node network that assigns the material to the selected faces.
    
:task:Create and update shader ball previews:
    - Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/cook] update all button to update the shader balls for all scene materials.
        
    - Right click a scene material and choose __Update shader ball icon__ to update a single material.
