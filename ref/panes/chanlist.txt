= Channel list =

The channel list lets you work with parameters, and makes it easy to edit values and channel groups, and manage the currently scoped parameters.


TIP:
    The channel list is also available as a sub-pane of the  [animation editor|/ref/panes/animeditor] .

The Channel Group list shows all channel groups. Press ((RMB)) on a group to
see a context menu for the group.

The Parameter list shows the parameters on the selected objects and/or in the selected channel groups. Select parameters in the list to scope them. 

When you select objects, the channel list shows parameters of the object that either are keyed already, or are marked "auto scope". "Auto scope" is a property of commonly-animated parameters that makes them automatically show up in the channel list. See [auto-scope
parameters|/anim/scope].

In addition to the [value-editing techniques and shortcuts|/ref/panes/parms]  available in the parameter editor, you can also select multiple value boxes at once in the parameter list and type or use the ((MMB)) value ladder to change them all at once.

Press ((RMB)) in one of the sub-panes to show commands and options specific to the sub-pane. Press ((RMB)) on items in the lists to show commands and options for the item.

:task:Select multiple parameters in the parameter list:
        Click ((LMB)) while holding ((Shift)) to select individual parameters.
        
        or
        
        Hold ((Shift + LMB)) and drag to select a few at once.

:task:Group parameters together into a channel group:
    Select the parameters in the parameter list and drag-and-drop into the Channel Group list.
    
    or
    
    Press ((RMB)) on selected parameters to create new groups or add parameters to existing groups.
    
:task:Collapse transforms:
        Click the ((-)) icon to collapse transforms, and the ((+)) to expand.
        
        NOTE:
                You can also collapse at the object level by clicking the arrow.

:task:Scope the parameters in a group (and all subgroups):
    Click the group in the group list.

:task:Keep a channel group or parameter always visible in the parameter list:
    Click the pin icon next to the group or parameter. Click the
    icon again to unpin it.

:task:Set keyframes on the parameters in a channel group:
    Click ((RMB)) and select __Set Key on Groups__.

:task:Remove keyframes on the parameters in a channel group:
    Click ((RMB)) and select __Remove Key from Groups__.
