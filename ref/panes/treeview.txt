= Tree view =

The tree view shows a hierarchical list of all nodes in the scene. This
view does not show how nodes are connected (like the [network
editor|/ref/panes/network] , but gives you quick access to
them by name.

There are several ways to access the tree view:

* Create a new pane, or change a pane into a tree view (see [panes|/basics/panes].

* Choose __Windows > Tree view__ to open the tree view in a new floating window.

* To open a tree view as a sub-pane in a [network
editor|/ref/panes/network] or [parameter
  editor|/ref/panes/parms] pane, right click the network background and turn on __View controls > Show tree__.

:task:Filter the display:
    * Click one of the icons at the top of the pane to limit the
      display to a certain type of node.

      If a node that should be visible is inside a subnet, the
      parents of the node will be visible, even if they would
      otherwise be filtered out.

    * Hold ((Shift)) and click to turn on more than one icon at a
      time.

    * Click the icon again to go back to showing all nodes.

:task:Show a menu of commands for a node:
    * Press ((RMB)) on the node's name in the tree.

:task:Show information about a node:
    * Press ((MMB)) on the node's name in the tree.

:task:Automatically go into container nodes when you click them:
    * By default, selecting a node view will select the node in any
      linked Network panes. If you turn on the __Auto-Dive__ button,
      selecting the operator will instead display the node's
      contents in any linked Network panes.
