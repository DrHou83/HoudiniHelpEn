This example shows you how the primintrinsic method 
can be used to obtain the number of vertices for a primitive. 
The point corresponding to a vertex can be obtained 
by first translating a primitive-vertex offset pair 
to a linear vertex value then looking up the point referenced 
by the linear vertex value.
