This example demonstrates using the Fractal SOP to deform geometry to get a random, jagged subdivision surface. This is a useful tool in creating things such as bumpy terrains, landscapes, rocks, or debris.

The Fractal SOP is applied to each geometry type to show how the displacement changes based on the geometry type.
