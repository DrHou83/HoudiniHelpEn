This network utilizes the Blendshapes SOP to morph one geometry's colors into another's color.

Two input blend shapes act as inputs for the Blendshapes SOP.

The Blendshapes SOP interpolates all designated attributes, in this case "Cd" between the various inputs.

Play the animation to see the effect.
