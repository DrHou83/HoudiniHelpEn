This example demonstrates how to transfer attributes from the points on one geometry to the points on another, using the AttribTransfer SOP.

A line is crept along the surface of a deformed grid. A section of the grid is painted red using the Paint SOP. Using the AttribTransfer SOP, the animated line inherits the attributes from the points on the grid.

Particles are then birthed along the line based on the color attribute (Cd). As the inherited color nears red, particles are born. The particles also use the velocity inherited by the points on the line.

Please press play to see the animation.
