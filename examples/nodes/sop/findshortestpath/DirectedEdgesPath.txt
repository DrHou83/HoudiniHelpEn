#exampleFile: DirectedEdgesPath.otl

This is an example of how to use the FindShortestPath SOP to find a path through geometry where certain edges are directed edges.  Directed edges can only be traversed in one direction.

Try changing the start and end points, as well as the directed edges, to explore how the SOP avoids going the wrong direction, and cannot reach points with only outgoing edges.
