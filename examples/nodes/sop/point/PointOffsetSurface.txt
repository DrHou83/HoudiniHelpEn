Using the Point SOP, a simple displacement is created and applied to a portion of a spherical surface.

Using the normals of a point, which is basically a vector, and adding that number to the position of the point, the point is displaced in that given direction. With a Merge and Skin SOP the displaced surface is then connected back to the original.
