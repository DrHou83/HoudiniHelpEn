This example of the Point SOP demonstrates the capacity of the Point SOP to alter geometry based on another input.

A sphere is created and then the points are randomly transformed. Then, by using both inputs of the Point SOP, the original sphere is brought back to average out its altered form. A simple math expression averages the positions of the two spheres, point by point.
