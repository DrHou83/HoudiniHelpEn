This is an example of how to use the Point SOP to orient point normals along a path. This allows for control over the orientation of geometry when copied onto points.

Points are extracted along a spiral on a per frame basis using an expression in the Carve SOP. A cone is copied to these points sequentially and results in an animation along the path.
