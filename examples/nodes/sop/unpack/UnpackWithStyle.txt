#exampleFile: UnpackWithStyle.otl

This example demonstrates the Unpack SOPs ability to evaluate style sheet
information while unpacking. Nested packed primitives are used to demonstrate
partial unpacking while still preserving styling information. This example
also demonstrates the use of a Python SOP to extract information from the
per-primitive style sheets.
