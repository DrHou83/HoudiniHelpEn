This example demonstrates how the UV information on surfaces, NURBS in this
example, are used by the Align SOP to orient one object to another's
surface.

UV reference parameters in the Align SOP can be animated as shown in the
align_tube example.

Animating UV parameters leads to the translation
and rotation of the aligned geometries along one another's surface in various
ways.
