The Copy SOP is used to copy geometry to particles using the Particle SOP as a template.  In the example, the Scale parameter of the Copy SOP is used to create the specific effect.  The Copy SOP may also be used to control different attributes of the copied geometry beyond mere scale. 

Play the animation to see the effects.
