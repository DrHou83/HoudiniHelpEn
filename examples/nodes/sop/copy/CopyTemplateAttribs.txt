The Copy SOP is used to transfer specific attributes from a template to copied primitives.  In this example, a sphere is use as a template with color attributes added to the sphere points.  A Particle SOP is then used to birth particles from the sphere points.

Next, a Copy SOP does two things:

* It copies geometry to the particles.

* It transfers the color attribute from the source sphere points to the geometry whose position is based on the particles.

Play the animation to see the effects.
