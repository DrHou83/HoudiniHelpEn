In this example, the Copy SOP is used to randomly copy various objects onto points of a given template geometry.  We use the stamp capability of the Copy SOP for our purpose.  Furthermore, the entire process is kept procedural so that we have the option of determining the type and the number of geometries to be copied and the kind of template to be used.

Inside the Stamp tab of the Copy SOP we create a variable named "switch" which will drive the input value of the Select Input parameter in the Switch SOP.  In turn, the Copy SOP is able to copy at random any number of input geometry to template points.
