The Copy SOP can be used for more than copying geometry.  In this example, the Copy SOP is used to transfer color attributes from the template geometry (or point) to the copied geometry.  

A polygonal sphere with color infomation is used as the source geometry.  A point with a color attribute (Cd) is extracted from the sphere and used as a template by the Copy SOP.  Then the Copy SOP transfers the color infomation to a copied polygonal circle.
