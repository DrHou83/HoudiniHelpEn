This example demonstrates the power of the Copy SOP's Stamp operation.

Here, a Copy SOP is used to copy a circle onto the points of a sphere. The Stamp operation then applies various modifications to those copies based on division, scale, color, and extrusion. This results in the generation of a randomized variety of "stars".

Starting with a simple circle, a large number of variations are created using in the copies through the use of Stamping with expressions.
