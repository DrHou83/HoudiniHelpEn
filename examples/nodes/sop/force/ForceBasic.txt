This example file uses the Force SOP in conjunction with Metaball SOPs and Particle SOPs to create dynamic animations.

Using the Radial Force Parameter of the Force SOP, particles are puffed in and out. Then, using the Directional Force Parameter, a rotating vortex is created as a metaball spins around an axis.

Press play to view the animation.
