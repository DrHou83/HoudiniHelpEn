This example uses a Metaball SOP and a Force SOP to push particles side to side as they pass through a particle stream generated by a Particle SOP.

Particles are birthed in the air off of a sphere, while a metaball passes back and forth through, pushing the particles from its path.

Play the animation to see the full effect.
