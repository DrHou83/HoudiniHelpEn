This example demonstrates how to create a fluttering leaf simulation by using the Particle SOP.

It also demonstrates how to use the Point SOP to modify point normals, affecting the velocity and direction of particles. Since particles are actually points in space, the Point SOP is a powerful way to control particle attributes.

Press play to watch the simulation.
