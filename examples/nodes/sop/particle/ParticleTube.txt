The Particle SOP enables the creation of particles at the SOP level and allows those particles to directly interact with geometry. Furthermore, these particles are in turn treated as point geometry. 

In this example, particles are both crept along and collided with a collision tube object. It is possible to also manipulate and control particles in SOPs through the adjustment of point normals (including those of the particles).
