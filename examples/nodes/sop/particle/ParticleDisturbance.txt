#exampleFile: ParticleDisturbance.otl

The given example file takes a grid, and using the Particle SOP in combination with the Metaball and Force SOPs, creates a dynamic animation. 

A metaball ship jets through space driving particles out of its path along the wake of the ship. With the help of the Force SOP, the metaballs are given the properties necessary to make this reaction possible.

Play the animation to see the full effect.
