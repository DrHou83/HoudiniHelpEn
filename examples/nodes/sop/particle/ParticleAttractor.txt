This example file demonstrates using the Metaball and Force SOPs to affect particles generated by the Particle SOP.

Particles are birthed from the origin and shot towards a still metaball. The metaball has a Force SOP applied to it causing the particles, upon reaching the metaball, to spread away from it out into space.
