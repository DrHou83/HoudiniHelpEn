#exampleFile: CreepWeave.otl

This example shows how you can take a geometry and creep it over an animated surface.

A file, fabric.bgeo, which looks like woven fabric, has been brought in using the File SOP. A NURBS grid has been animated to look like a piece of waving fabric using sine and noise functions.

The fabric.bgeo is crept over the animated NURBS grid, using a Creep SOP, and the result is an animated piece of woven fabric.
