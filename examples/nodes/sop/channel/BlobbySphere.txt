This is a simple example of how to utilize the Channel SOP to bring information from CHOPs into SOPs and apply it to geometry.  

We use an animated sphere and create a lag in the animation of selected areas of the sphere.  

In a CHOP network, the Geometry CHOP brings in point position data of the sphere geometry and runs it through a Lag CHOP for the delaying effect.  The Channel SOP then references the Lag CHOP and applies the point data back to the selected areas of the original NURBS sphere.
