This is an Advanced example.

This network contains example of how the Channel SOP can be used in conjunction with a POP network to manipulate geometry at the SOP level.  

First a simple particle network allows the creation and collision of
particles sourced from grid geometry.

Next the positional data of the particles is evaluated through a CHOP network using a Geometry CHOP.  The Geometry CHOP returns the tx, ty and tz values for every particle birthed in the POP network.

Then, a Channel SOP brings the positional data back to the geometry level
and applies it to the points on the original grid surface.
