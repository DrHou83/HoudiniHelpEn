#exampleFile: RayWrap.otl

The Ray SOP projects one object over the surface contours of another. 

It does so by calculating the collisions of the projected object's normals with the surface geometry of the collided object.

In this example, a Grid is wrapped over the surface of a deformed Sphere using the Ray SOP.

A Facet SOP is used to correct the normals of the wrapped Grid after it is deformed over the surface.
