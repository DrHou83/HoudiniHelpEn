The Font SOP is used to create 3D text geometry in the scene.

The geometry may be set to Polygon, Bezier, or a combination of the two. 

With the combination, Bezier will be used for letters containing curves, and Polygon will be used for those with only straight edges.

Fonts other than those loaded by default may be loaded in the Font parameter.
