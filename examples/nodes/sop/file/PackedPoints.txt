This example shows how you can use the file sop to 
do a delayed load of packed disk primitives to have multiple 
geometry samples per frame for rendering motion blur.
If you save out the packed disk geometry, you're really 
only saving out the point geometry with references to 
the disk files (which is very light weight).
