This example demonstrates the Revolve SOP's ability to create geometry by spinning curves and surfaces around any described axis. Simple objects, such as a torus and a vase, are generated by the Revolve SOP and user-defined inputs. 

This file also shows off how different geometry types react to different Revolve SOP parameter changes.
