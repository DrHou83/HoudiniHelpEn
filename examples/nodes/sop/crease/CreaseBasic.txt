This demonstration contains four different examples of applying the creaseweight attribute to polygonal geometry utilizing the Crease SOP, Vertex SOP, Attribute Create SOP, and Subdivide SOP.

It also points out some of the differences between rendering with Mantra vs. RenderMan. It is important to know that Mantra can not render the creases due to Copyright laws.

NOTE:
	Rendering creases with Mantra requires the addition of a Subdivision SOP for calculating the geometry. The Render tab's Geometry parameter at the object level should be set to: Geometry As Is.

If Renderman is being used, the Subdivide SOP is only for previewing the result. Renderman calculates creases during the render. The Render tab's Geometry parameter at the object level should be set to: Polygons as Subdivision Surfaces.
