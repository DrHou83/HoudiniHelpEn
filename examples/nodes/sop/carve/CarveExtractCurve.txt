This network is a demonstration of how the Carve SOP can be used to extract
various elements of the surface geometry.

Depending on the type of geometry, the Carve SOP may be used to extract
points from polygonal objects or curves from NURBS surfaces.

Furthermore, the Carve SOP uses the surface U and V information to extract
the various elements, and by animating the U and V values we can create
various effects as the points and curves move on the geometry surface.
