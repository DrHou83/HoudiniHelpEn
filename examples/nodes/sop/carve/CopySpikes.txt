This network contains an example of how the Carve SOP can extract 3D Isoparametric Curves from a surface, and how those curves may be used as a copy template.

The Carve SOP can be used to slice a primitive, cut it into multiple sections, or extract points or cross-sections from it.

In this example, the Extract option has been used to Extract 3D Isoparametric Curve(s). A series of disk-like shapes are created as the Carve SOP extracts curves from points around the surface with the same V Directional value. 

It then uses the points along those curves as a template on which to copy sourced geometry.
