This network is a demonstration of the Carve SOP, specifically when dealing with extracting curves from a NURBs surface and animating that extraction.

The Carve SOP uses the U and V surface data to carve the geometry.

In our example we have extracted curves which can then be used as basis for other geometry to create interesting effects.

Given the Carve SOP uses a 0 to 1 value to carve either in the U or V surface direction, that value can be animated either by keyframing or through expressions.
