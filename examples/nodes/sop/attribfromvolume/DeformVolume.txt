Here's a simple example showing how you can deform a volume.
First create a 3d grid of points with the box sop with 
divisions matching the resolution of the volume. 
Next, transfer the density from the volume on those points. 
Finally, the points can be deformed any way you want, 
and then you can create an empty volume and fill it 
with the densities from the points.
