This network contains an example of the Sweep SOP.  A NURBS curve and NURBS circles are used as the backbone and the cross section geometries of the sweep operation respectively.
  
By controling the scaling of the cross section geometry in the Sweep SOP various effects can be acheived.  Finally, a Skin SOP completes the form by using the swept geometry as a kind of skeleton.
