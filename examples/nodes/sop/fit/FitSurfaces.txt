This contains examples of fitting a Polygon Mesh to a NURBS surface through the use of the Fit SOP. There are two methods of fitting:

- Approximation, which generates primitives that roughly follow the path of the
  data points.
  
- Interpolation, which generates primitives that touch all the data points.
