This is an example of how to use the Fit SOP to fit a NURBs curve to a basic polygon curve.

Fitting builds a new NURBs or Bezier curve through the input geometry's points. 

There are two methods for doing this:

Interpolation fitting outputs the same number of cv's as the input curve (Original Polygon Curve). 

Approximation fitting reduces the number of cv's, while approximating a curve through the input points.

Play the animation to see how these two methods affect the resultant curve over time.
