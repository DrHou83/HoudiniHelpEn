#exampleFile: AttribCopyTessel.otl

This is an example of how to transfer attributes from one geometry to another using the AttribCopy SOP. 

A "smiley face" is painted onto a grid as a color attribute using the Paint SOP. The attribute is then transferred to another grid. Because of a discrepancy between the sizes of the grid, a tesselation occurs.

When there are differences between the sizes of the geometry, the AttribCopy SOP will repeat the pattern of the attribute in a cyclic fashion.
