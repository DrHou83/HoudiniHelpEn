#exampleFile: BasicJoin.otl

This example demonstrates how the Join SOP can connect multiple pieces of geometry by faces and surfaces.

The Join SOP will combine the individual pieces of geometry into a single primitive that will inherit attributes.

Nurbs, Bezier, or Mesh surfaces should be used with the Join SOP. 

Do not use Polygons as it will not work with the Join SOP.
