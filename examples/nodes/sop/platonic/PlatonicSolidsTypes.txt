The Platonic Solids SOP generates platonic solids of different types. Platonic solids are polyhedrons which are convex and have all the vertices and faces of the same type. There are only five such objects, which form the first five choices of this operation.

This example shows all seven of the different polyhedron forms that can be made using the Platonic Solids SOP.
