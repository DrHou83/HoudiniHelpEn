This example shows how to cap two designated areas of a geometry by creating groups.

Two Group SOPs are used to create two groups, group_bottom and group_middle. These groups are created using Number Enable. The Pattern number corresponds to the primitive number, which you can see by turning on primitive numbers.

Two Cap SOPs are used to cap the two groups. By capping either the First V Cap or Last V Cap, you can select which end of the group you want to cap.
