#exampleFile: ConvToTrimSurface.otl

This example shows how to create a trimmed NURBS or Bezier surface using the Convert SOP.

There are four examples contained that compare how a trimmed surface handles a texture.

- *Grid Surface* a simple texture map on a grid.

- *Trimmed Circle Using the Trim SOP* the conventional way of creating a trimmed surface using a Project SOP and a Trim SOP.

- *Trimmed Circle Using the Convert SOP* creates a trimmed surface using a Convert SOP.

- *NURBS Surface Using the Convert SOP* shows how a texture is parametrized over a surface that is not trimmed.

To get a better sense of the parameterization of the texture, turn on points and toggle between wireframe and shaded modes.
