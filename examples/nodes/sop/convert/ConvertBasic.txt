This example shows the various ways in which the Convert SOP converts geometry types using a simple sphere.

A chart is used for this demonstration.

The left column of the chart describes the original geometry type to convert from.

The top row of the chart describes the geometry type to convert to.

All Sphere SOPs and Convert SOPs in this demonstration use their default values to better visualize the differences.
