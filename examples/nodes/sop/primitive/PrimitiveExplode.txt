#exampleFile: PrimitiveExplode.otl

This file demonstrates the ability of the Primitive SOP to control the individual primitives of the object.

With expressions in the Translate Parameter, motion is created driving the primitives away from their centroid. Yet another expression presents the primitives with a randomized rotation. Another randomizing expression colorizes each of the primitives. 

Together these parameter create an explosion destroying the original sphere.
