#exampleFile: PrimCenter.otl

This is an example of how to use the Primitive SOP to correctly sweep primitives on a curve. 

The Sweep SOP places the origin of a primitive on a curve by default. If the primitive centroid is away from the origin, the primitive will be placed away from the curve.

In order to correctly place the primitive's centroid on the backbone, its centroid must be at the origin. For this, the Primitive SOP is used.
