This example demonstrates various ways in which you can use a 
solver node to transform an object based on ordinary differential equations.

There are 6 different solvers in this example.
There is also the exact answer as a point of reference.
The solvers are numerical methods that solve the following 
coupled Ordinary Differential Equations with initial conditions:

{{{
x' = y ; x(0) = 1
y' = -x ; y(0) = 0
}}}

The numerical methods for Ordinary Differential Equations are: 
Forward Euler, Runge-Kutta Second Order, Runge-Kutta Third Order, 
Runge-Kutta Fourth Order, and Parker-Sochacki solved two ways. 
In one version, Parker-Sochacki is hard coded at order 5. 
In another version Parker-Sochacki is written in a for loop 
where the order can be adjusted by the user.
