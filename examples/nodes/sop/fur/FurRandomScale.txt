This example demonstrates how a CVEX shader can be used to apply procedural
effects to the curves generated by the Fur SOP.  All attributes from the
Fur SOP's guide geometry and the skin geometry inputs are made available to
the CVEX shaders.  The CVEX shader makes use of the attributes, a unique
identifier for each curve, "fur_id", and the position of each point, "P".
