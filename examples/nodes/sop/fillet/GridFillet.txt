The Fillet SOP is used to create a bridge between two NURBS surfaces with control over its parameterization. The fillet uses the original surface uv information for bridging.

Fillet types may include Freeform, Convex or Circular.  The Freeform fillet usually provides a smooth natural form.  Such parameters as the left and right UV, Width, Scale, and Offset may be used to control the fillet location between the surfaces.
