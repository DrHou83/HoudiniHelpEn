This example demonstrates the various options for joining polygons using the PolyKnit SOP. The PolyKnit SOP is useful for filling in holes, gaps, or to re-define edges on polygonal geometry.

PolyKnit can be used to manually knit joining polygons between existing polygons. Polygons are created by specifying a list of input points from which to "knit" the new polygons.

PolyKnit will yield different results, depending on the pattern by which the points are selected or listed. Please see the Helpcard documentation for more information on how the PolyKnit SOP builds new polygons.
