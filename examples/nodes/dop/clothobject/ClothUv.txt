This is an example that shows how you can specify the warped and weft directions on a triangulated cloth planel using uv coordinates.

Because the uv directions are aligned with the xy directions of the grid, the result looks nearly identical to a quad grid, even though the mesh is triangulated.

The little blue and yellow lines visualize the directions of the cloth fabric. This is enabled in the Visualization tab of both cloth objects.
