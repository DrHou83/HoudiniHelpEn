This example actually includes eight examples of ways that 
you can use voronoi fracturing in Houdini. In particular, it 
shows how you can use the Voronoi Fracture Solver and the 
Voronoi Fracture Configure Object nodes in your fracture 
simulations. Turn on the display flags for these examples 
one at a time to play the animation and dive down into 
each example to examine the setup.
