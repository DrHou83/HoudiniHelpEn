= Stadium Crowd Example =

"""Crowd example showing a stadium setup"""

The setup creates a stadium crowd. The rotating cheer_bbox object is used as a bounding box for the agents. When they are inside it it will trigger a transition from a sitting to a cheering state. After a few seconds the cheering crowd sits back down by transitioning into a sitting state.



NOTE:
        The animation clips need to be baked out before playing the scene. This should happen automatically if example is created from Crowds shelf. Otherwise save scene file to a location of your choice and click Render on '/obj/bake_cycles' ropnet to write out the files. The default path for the files is ${HIP}/agents.
        
TIP:
        To only see a section of the crowd for quicker preview there's a switch node in /obj/crowdsource/switch_all_subsection. When 0 it will show all agents, when set to 1 will only show a small section.
