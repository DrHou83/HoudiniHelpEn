This example uses the RBD Keyframe Active node to switch from a
keyframed animation to an RBD Solver, and back to keyframed animation.
This same animation could be created using a Switch Solver or Blend
Solver, but this approach is simpler if the only requirement is switching
from keyframed to simulated motion for a few RBD Objects.
