This example simulates grass being pushed down by an RBD object.  Fur Objects
are used to represent the blades of grass and Wire Objects are used to
simulate the motion.  When a single Fur Object is used to represent the grass,
neighbouring blades of grass will have similar motion.  Additional objects
with different stiffness values can be used to make the motion less uniform.
When "Complex Mode" is enabled, two objects are used to represent the grass.
The stiffness of each set of curves can be controlled by adjusting the
"Angular Spring Constant" and "Linear Spring Constant" parameters on the
corresponding Wire Objects.
