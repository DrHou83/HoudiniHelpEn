#exampleFile: GuidedWrinkling.hda

This is a setup for guided wrinkling using the hybrid object.
The first sim creates a detailed mesh consisting of both tets and triangles that doesn't have any wrinkles yet.
The second sim is targeted to the animation creates by the first sim and this adds in the wrinkles.
