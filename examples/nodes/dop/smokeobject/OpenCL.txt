= Open CL smoke =

Demonstrates a simple Open CL accelerated smoke sim that can be
used as a starting point for building optimized GPU accelerated
smoke sims. See the [Use OpenCL|/nodes/dop/smokesolver#opencl] parameter on the [Smoke solver|Node:dop/smokesolver].

For fastest speeds, the system needs to minimize copying to and from the video card. This example demonstrates several methods for minimizing copying.
	
* Turns off DOPs caching. Caching requires copying *all* the fields every frame. Useful if you want to scrub and inspect random fields, not if you want maximum speed.

* Only imports density to SOPs. This means copying only one field from the GPU to CPU each frame.

* Saves to disk in background. This gives you the best throughput.

* Uses a plain [Smoke solver|Node:dop/smokesolver].

Displaying the simulated output in the viewport requires a GPU -> CPU -> GPU round trip, but this is required in general to support simulating on a card other than your display card.
