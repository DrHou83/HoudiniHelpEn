#exampleFile: VisualizeImpacts.otl

An example that shows how you can visualize impact data in an RBD
simulation by using a SOP Solver to add custom guide geometry to the
RBD Objects.

This example has three toruses falling on a grid with
green lines showing the position and magnitude of impacts.  The force
visualization is added as ancillary geometry data to the actual
toruses, so the RBD Solver is entirely unaware of the effect.
The SOP Solver could also be used as an independent SOP network to extract
impact visualization from an RBD Object.
