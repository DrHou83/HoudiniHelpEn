This example combines a number of important DOPs concepts.

- First, it uses both POP Solver and RBD Solver objects
  interacting with each other in a bidiretional manner. The RBD object affects
  the particles, and the particles affect the RBD object.
  
- Second, the RBD object atually uses a multi-solver to combine an RBD
  Solver with a SOP Solver. The RBD Solver controls the motion
  of the overall object, while the SOP Solver performs the denting of the
  geometry.
  
- Third, the SOP Solver extracts impact information from the RBD
  Solver to perform the denting. It extracts this information using DOP
  expression functions.
  
The end result is a simulation of a torus that is bombarded by a stream of
particles. The particles bounce off the torus, and also cause the torus to
move. In addition, each particle collision causes a slight denting of the
torus.
