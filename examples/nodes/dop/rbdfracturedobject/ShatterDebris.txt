This example demonstrates the how the shatter, RBD Fractured Object, 
and Debris shelf tools can be used to create debris emanating from 
fractured pieces of geometry.

First, the Shatter tool (from the Model tool shelf) is used on the 
glass to define the fractures. Then the RBD Fracture tool is used 
on the glass to create RBD objects out of the fractured pieces. 
Then the Debris tool is used on the RBD fractured objects to 
create debris.
