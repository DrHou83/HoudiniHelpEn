This somewhat complicated example is meant to demonstrate a simple
workflow for simulating, storing, surfacing and rendering a particle
fluid simulation.  Three geometry nodes in the example are named
Step 1, Step 2 and Step 3 according to the order in which they are
to be used.  They write out particle geometry to disk, read the geometry
in and surface it, and read the surfaced geometry from disk, respectively.
The example also has shaders and a camera built in so that it can be
easily rendered.

The fluid animated in this scene models a highly-elastic
gelatin-like blob of fluid.
