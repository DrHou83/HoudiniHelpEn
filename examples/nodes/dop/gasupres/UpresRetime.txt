This example demonstrates how the Up Res Solver can now be used  
to re-time an existing simulation. 
The benefit of this is that one can simply change the speed
without affecting the look of the sim.
On the up-res solver there is a tab called Time. The Time tab 
offers various controls to change the simulation's speed.
