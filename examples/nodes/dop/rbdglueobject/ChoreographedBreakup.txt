This example shows how one can control the break up of any glued
object through the use of the RBD State node.

A torus, composed of spheres, is glued together.  An additional
sweep plane is defined.  Any sphere which ends up on the wrong side of
the sweep plane is broken off the torus and left to bounce on its own.
This lets the break up of the torus to be controlled over many
frames.
