This example shows how to set up the indirectlight object for caustic
photon map generation and also how light masks and photon targets should be
used.  The scene consists of a reflective tube and a point and environment
light.  Each light has a corresponding indirectlight to generate caustics,
with the light mask configured to allow the light to generate photons only
from the specified light.  The photon target is used to ensure that photons
are only sent toward the reflective tube.  The mantra ROP will produce deep
raster planes for the direct_diffuse component on a per-light basis,
showing the diffuse illumination from the two lights and the caustics split
into separate planes.
