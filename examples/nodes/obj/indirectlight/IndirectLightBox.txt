This example shows how to set up the indirectlight object for indirect
diffuse lighting.  The scene consists of a box that has been extruded
several times, containing a light source and the camera.  The light has
been placed so that all light reaching the camera must bounce more than
once inside the scene before reaching the camera.  The indirectlight object
is configured to generate 1000000 photons.  To visualize the photon map,
change the rendering mode on the light to "Direct Global Photon Map".  To
adjust the sampling quality, modify the pixel samples or ray samples on the
mantra ROP.  The rendering engine used in this example is PBR.
