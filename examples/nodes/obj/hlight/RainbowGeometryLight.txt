This example highlights several features:
- Geometry area lights
- Attenuation ramp controls
- Surface model specular layers

The example consists of a geometry light based on a wireframe of nurbs
curves.  The attenuation on the light uses colored keys, allowing for
different light colors to be produced at different distances from the
light.  The ground plane shader uses a surface model with two specular
components - one wide component and another narrower glossy component to
give a multi-layered appearance.
