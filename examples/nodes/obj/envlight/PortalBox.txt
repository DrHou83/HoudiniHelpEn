#exampleFile: PortalBox.otl

This example shows how to create a portal light using window geometry.  A
box is modeled and then split into 2 SOPs - one representing windows and
the other walls.  The walls are rendered, while the windows are used to
specify the portal for an environment light.  Toggle on and off the portal
to see the render quality difference while rendering in the Render View.
