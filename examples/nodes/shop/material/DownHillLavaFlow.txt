= Down Hill Lava Flow =

#type: example

In this file we create a downhill lava flow with crust gathering and hardening at the base of the slope. All of the animation is achieved through the shader itself, and all of the geometry is completely static.

NOTE:
    Most of the parameters for the lava material are overridden by point attributes created in the surface nodes.
