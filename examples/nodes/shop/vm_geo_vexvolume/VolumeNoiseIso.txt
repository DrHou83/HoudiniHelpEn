This example shows how to render an isosurface defined by a cvex shader
using mantra's volume rendering capabilities.  A noise field is generated
by a cvex shader, which is attached to the VEX Volume Procedural.  The
volume is shaded by finding the surface where the density crosses 0, and
then shading using a simple surface shader that shows the normals.
