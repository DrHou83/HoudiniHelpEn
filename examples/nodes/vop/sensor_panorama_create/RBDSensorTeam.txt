An example demonstrating an AI playing a very simple game. The objective for each set of particles is to move the blue ball to the opposite side of the field. 

The particles are guided using the same technique, if the ball is located between them and the opponents side, they push the ball. Otherwise the particles move close to the ball and circle around so that they will be able to move the ball.

In order to make the simulation more dynamic, the particles are configured with a difference coefficient or friction and acceleration. This configuration allows the green cubes to move at a higher speed while the red particles are able to push stronger.

Sensor Panorama create is used to a view for each agent, displaying the ball and other players. Then Sensor Parnorama Cone commands are use to query their view to determine where the ball is (obscured by the other players) and move such that they can push the ball.
