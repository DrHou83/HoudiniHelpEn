#exampleFile: PointCloudWrite.otl

This example shows how the pcwrite vop can be used to write out points to a
point cloud file.  Render the mantra1 ROP to generate the point cloud, then
view the point cloud with gplay.  The distribution of points will depend on
where mantra shaders are executed - in this case, the mantra ROP is
configured to shade hidden surfaces allowing the back faces of the sphere
to generate points.
