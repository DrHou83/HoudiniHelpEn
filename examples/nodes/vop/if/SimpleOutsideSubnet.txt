This is a very simple example of using the If-Then Block VOP with the
"true" value coming from outside the If-Then subnet, and the "false" value
also coming from outside the If-Then subnet.

In this example, the red color is used if the value fed into the condition
is not True, and blue if the condition being fed in is True.
