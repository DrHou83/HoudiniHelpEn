This is a simple example of using the If-Then Block VOP with the "true"
value coming from outside the If-Then subnet, and the "false" value also
coming from outside the If-Then subnet.

A Condition VOP is used based on the "t" Global Variable. When "t" is less
then .5, the If-Then gets a "false" Condition, and when "t" is equal to or
greater than .5, the If-Then gets a "true" Condition.

In this example, the red color is used if the value fed into the condition
is not True, and blue if the condition being fed in is True.
