This example demonstrates how to set attributes on a particle based on
the value of a volume at the particle's position.

To accomplish this, you can use a [VOP POP|Node:pop/voppop] to edit the
particles, using the [Volume Sample from File VOP|Node:vop/volumesamplefile] to sample the volume.

In the example, particles are colored differently based on whether they
are "in" or "out" of the volume, where "in" is defined in the example
as "the value in the volume is > 0 at the position of the particle",
but could easily be changed.
