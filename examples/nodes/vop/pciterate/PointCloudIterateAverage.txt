#exampleFile: PointCloudIterateAverage.otl

This example shows how the pciterate vop can be used to average together
points returned by pcopen.  First, a point cloud is generated with a
floating point "check" channel initialized to 1 inside a circle in the x-z
plane.  Then, the points are filtered in a shader by looping using the
pciterate vop and averaging the value of the "check" channel.  The point
cloud used in the example is stored inside the asset as points.pc.
