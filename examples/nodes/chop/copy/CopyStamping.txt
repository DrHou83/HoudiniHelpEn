#exampleFile: CopyStamping.otl

This example demonstrates how to use the CopyStamp feature of the Copy CHOP. Custom variables are created within the Copy CHOP and used to modify the geometry.

In the file, geometry is imported into CHOPS. The Alpha attribute is scoped and manipulated using the Copy Stamping technique. 

The new Alpha data is then brought back to the SOP level, and applied to the geometry's Position.
