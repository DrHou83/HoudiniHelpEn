This is a simple example of using the Channel CHOP along with a Noise CHOP to
add some variety to keyframed animation that can still be easily tweaked as
keyframe animation. Notice that the object can be manipulated as usual in the
viewport transparently. The values will be modified in the Channel CHOP.
