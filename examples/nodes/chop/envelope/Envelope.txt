This example illustrates how the Envelope CHOP outputs the maximum amplitude of a channel in the vicinity of each sample of the input. Here, envelope1 and envelope2 try to follow the maximum amplitude of the noisy curve they use as input.

To visualize the channels in this demonstration, please enter the CHOP network and use the default CHOPs desktop.
