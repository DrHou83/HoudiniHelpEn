#exampleFile: LookAtTargetAndOffset.hda

The first example shows a LookAt constraint with a global Y axis up vector.
The second example shows a LookAt constraint with its up vector driven by an object.
The third example shows a LookAt constraint applied with Keep Position turned on.
The CHOP Offset node, after the constraint, makes the object keep its orientation
when the constraint is applied.
You can use the LookAt Shelf Tool to recreate the examples.
