You can chain the Composite CHOP together to take two or more channels
and do an ordered sequence blend. The Composite CHOP takes a control curve
and uses it to determine which channel to use with each Composite CHOP
working on two channels at a time, creating a sequence blend. The first
Composite node processes the first and second channel, the second
Composite node processes the result from the first node and the third
channel, and so on.

A key component of this network is the Limit CHOP. It processes the
control curve so the range is valid for the pair of channels being
processed by the associated Composite node.
