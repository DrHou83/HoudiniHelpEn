The Sequence CHOP is used to combine multiple waves into a single wave.  

This CHOP takes all its input CHOPs and appends one wave after another. It is expected the input CHOPs all have the same channels.

The end section of the first CHOP is overlapped with the start section of the second CHOP, and so on for the rest of the input CHOPs. The second input is shifted to line up with the end of the first.

To visualize the channels in this demonstration, please enter the CHOP network.
