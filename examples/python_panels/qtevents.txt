"""How Python Panels can listen to Qt events."""

This example handles the following events:

Resize:
    Triggered when the widget size changes, e.g. resizing the pane tab.

MouseMove:
    Triggered when the cursor moves and `setMouseTracking` is called on the widget.

Enter and Leave:
    Triggered when the cursor enters or leaves the widget.

Paint:
    Triggered when the widget should redraw.

In this example, Resize and MouseMove are used to track position and size, and Enter/Leave are used to track focus state. When Paint is called the position and size are displayed beside the cursor. The focus state is used to select a background color.
