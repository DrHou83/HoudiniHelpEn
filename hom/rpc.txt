=== Houdini RPC port ===

You can control Houdini remotely by accessing HOM through an RPC (remote
procedure call) interface over the network.  Houdini provides a built-in RPC
module, so you can control a remote copy of Houdini from a Python script.

You might also want to use RPC to communicate between two Python/hython
processes running on the same machine, or to communicate between Houdini
and Maya, for example.

To start Houdini's RPC server, type the following in Houdini's Python shell.

{{{
#!python
import hrpyc
hrpyc.start_server()
}}}

The RPC server will run in a separate thread, waiting for RPC calls from
other processes.  By default, it listens on port 18811.  If you'd like to run
it in the main thread, call `hrpyc.start_server(use_thread=False)`.

Now you can remotely control Houdini from another process (or on another
computer).  For example, in hython or Maya, you could connect to an RPC server
on the local machine with:

{{{
#!python
connection, hou = hrpyc.import_remote_module()
}}}

The `connection` variable needs to persist for the duration of the RPC
connection.  The `hou` variable behaves just like the `hou` module, and you
use it just like you would if you imported hou into a local session.

Note that the RPC server does not do any authentication by default, so you
should ensure that your firewall protects you from unauthorized access to the
RPC port.
