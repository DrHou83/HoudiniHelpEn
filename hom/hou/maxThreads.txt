:usage: `maxThreads()` -> `int`

When Houdini/hython is started, it uses all available processors on 
the machine for multi-threaded processing, unless overridden by the
`-j` command line option or the [Hom:hou.setMaxThreads] function.

This function returns that maximum number of threads that Houdini/hython
will use.
