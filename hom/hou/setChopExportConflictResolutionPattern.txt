"""Sets a CHOP node path pattern to take precedence when exporting to 
the same channel."""

:usage: `setChopExportConflictResolutionPattern(string pattern)` -> `None`

Sets a pattern for matching CHOP node paths that should take 
precedence when there are other CHOPs that override the same channels
thus leading to conflicts.
