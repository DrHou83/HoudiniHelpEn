"""Return the resolution of an image in a file."""

:usage: `imageResolution(image_file_name)` -> `tuple` of `int`

Returns the width and height of an image stored in a file.

Another way to get the resolution of an image is to load it into a file cop
and retrieve it.  For example, this method could be approximately implemented
as follows:

{{{
#!python
def imageResolution(image_file_name):
    file_cop = hou.node("/img/comp1").createNode("file")
    file_cop.setParm("filename1", image_file_name)
    resolution = (file_cop.xRes(), file_cop.yRes())
    file_cop.destroy()
    return resolution
}}}

Note, however, that this method is faster than loading the image into Houdini
and retrieving the resolution because it is much less disk intensive.  It
does not load the image data from disk, and instead only loads as much
as necessary to retrieve the resolution.

Raises [Hom:hou.OperationFailed] if the image file does not exist or if it's
not an image file type supported by Houdini.

The following example retrieves the resolution of the default.pic file that
ships with Houdini.
{{{
#!pycon
>>> hou.imageResolution(hou.findFile("pic/default.pic"))
(512, 512)
}}}
