"""Transparency rendering quality for the viewport"""

Quality levels for rendering objects with transparency in the viewport. 

@values

::hou.viewportTransparency.Cutout: 
    Fast test to render the transparent pixel as opaque (>0) or to discard it (0). This can be used for texture cards such as leaves. This doesn't require an additional pass for transparency.
  
::hou.viewportTransparency.Low: 
    Render transparent pixels in a separate pass. Only the front-most transparent pixel is rendered.
    
::hou.viewportTransparency.Medium: 
    Render transparent pixels in an Order-Independent buffer of 8 samples, which is then sorted and composited together to do multi-layer transparency for up to 8 layers of overlapping transparency.
  
::hou.viewportTransparency.High: 
    Render transparent pixels in an Order-Independent buffer of 16 samples, which is then sorted and composited together to do multi-layer transparency for up to 16 layers of overlapping transparency.
