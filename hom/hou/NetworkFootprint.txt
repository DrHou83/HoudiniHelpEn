"""Describes the conditions under which a footprint ring should be displayed for a node in a network editor pane."""

A footprint in the network editor is a ring drawn behind the node in the
network editor, such as the blue "display flag" ring around the `wave1` node
and the orange "output flag" ring around the `wave2` node:

[Image:/images/nodes/footprints.png]

This class describes to the network editor which nodes should be drawn with a
footprint, and the color and position of that footprint. A tuple of these
objects is passed to the [Hom:hou.NetworkEditor#setFootprints] method. This
tuple should be updated every time the current network changes to a new node
type category.

The default footprint setup for SOP nodes is the following:
{{{
    #!pycon
    >>> editor = hou.ui.paneTabOfType(hou.paneTabType.NetworkEditor)
    >>> editor.setFootprints([
	    hou.NetworkFootprint(
		hou.nodeFlag.Display,
		hou.ui.colorFromName('GraphDisplayHighlight'), 1, True
	    ),
	    hou.NetworkFootprint(
		hou.nodeFlag.Render,
		hou.ui.colorFromName('GraphRenderHighlight'), 0, True
	    ),
	    hou.NetworkFootprint(
		hou.nodeFlag.Template,
		hou.ui.colorFromName('GraphTemplateHighlight'), 2, True
	    ),
	    hou.NetworkFootprint(
		hou.nodeFlag.Footprint,
		hou.ui.colorFromName('GraphTemplateHighlight'), 2, True
	    ),
	    hou.NetworkFootprint(
		'output',
		hou.ui.colorFromName('GraphOutputHighlight'), 1, True
	    )
	])
}}}

@methods

::`__init__(self, condition, color, ring, use_minimum_size)`:
    #cppname: HOM_NetworkFootprint::HOM_NetworkFootprint
    Construct a new footprint descriptor.

    `condition`:
	Can be a [Hom:hou.nodeFlag] enum value, in which case any node with
	this flag set will be drawn with a footprint.
	Alternatively, a `string` value indicates a node type name, in which
	case any node of this type will be drawn with a footprint.

    `color`:
	The color used to draw the ring expressed as a [Hom:hou.Color].

    `ring`:
	An integer value from 0 to 4 indicating which ring is being described.
	Ring 0 is a circle that extends from the center of the node. Each
	subsequent ring is thinner and further from the center of the node.

    `use_minimum_size`:
	A boolean value. Set to `True` to indicate that the footprint should
	maintain a minimum visual size regardless of the network zoom level.
	Set to `False` if the footprint should scale with the network zoom
	level, even if that means the footprint becomes very small.
