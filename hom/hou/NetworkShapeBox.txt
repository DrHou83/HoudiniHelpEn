"""Describes a rectangular area that can be drawn into a network editor."""

This subclass of [Hom:hou.NetworkShape] describes a rectangle that can be
drawn into a network editor pane.

    #cppname: HOM_NetworkShapeBox::HOM_NetworkShapeBox
    Constructs a new box shape descriptor.

    `rect`:
	A [Hom:hou.BoundingRect] object which describes the size and position
	of the box. It may describe the box in screen space or in the network
	layout space, depending on the value of the `screen_space` parameter.
	This is the only required parameter.

    `color`:
	The color of the box, expressed as a [Hom:hou.Color].

    `alpha`:
	The alpha used when drawing the box, expressed as a float value
	between 0 and 1.

    `fill`:
	A boolean value indicating whether the box should be filled, or just
	drawn as an outline.

    `screen_space`:
	A boolean value indicating whether the `rect` parameter describes the
	box size and position in screen space or network layout space. If set
	to `True`, the rectangle is expressed as pixels relative to the lower
	left corner of the pane. If `False`, the rectangle is expressed in
	network units.

    `smooth`:
	A boolean value indicating whether lines should be drawn with
	smoothing turned on. Smoothing lines is a form of anti-aliasing which
	can make curved lines look better, but doing so may affect the color
	of the line. This parameter has no effect if `fill` is `True`.
