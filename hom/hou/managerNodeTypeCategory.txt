"""Return the NodeTypeCategory instance for Houdini manager nodes. The
manager nodes are /obj, /out, /part, /ch, /shop, /img, and /vex."""

:usage: `managerNodeTypeCategory()` -> NodeTypeCategory

Note that some container node types, like the shop network node type,
are called managers in Houdini. The node type category for an instance
of those nodes will be the same as other nodes in that same network. For
example, a shop network in objects will be in the objects node type
category, while a shop network in a sop network will be in the geometry
node type category.
