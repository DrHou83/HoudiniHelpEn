"""Replacement geometry for instances culled in the viewport."""

When using point instancing, instances can be culled because of the
__Point Instancing Percent__, or the __Instancing Limit__  display
options. Culled instances can be replaced by a marker or bounding box,
or completely hidden.


@values

:: DisplayOff
    Don't show anything for culled instances.
:: LocationMarker
    Show a point marker at the local space origin of the instance.
:: BoundingBox
    Show the bounding box of the culled instance.
