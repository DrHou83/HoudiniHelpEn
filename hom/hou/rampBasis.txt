"""Enumeration of ramp interpolation types."""

These interpolation types specify how Houdini interpolates between keyframed
values in a [Hom:hou.Ramp].  See [Hom:hou.Ramp#basis] and
[Hom:hou.Ramp#__init__] for more information about how to get and set ramp
interpolation types.


@values

:: Linear
    Does a linear (straight line) interpolation between keys.

:: Constant
    Holds the value constant until the next key.

:: CatmullRom
    Interpolates smoothly between the keys.
    See [Catmull-Rom_spline|Wp:Catmull-Rom_spline].

:: MonotoneCubic
    Another smooth interpolation that ensures that there is no overshoot.
    For example, if a key's value is smaller than the values in the adjacent
    keys, this type ensures that the interpolated value is never less than
    the key's value.

:: Bezier
    Cubic Bezier curve that interpolates every third control point and uses the
    other points to shape the curve.
    See [Bezier curve|Wp:Bezier_curve].

:: BSpline
    Cubic curve where the control points influence the shape of the curve
    locally (that is, they influence only a section of the curve).
    See [B-Spline|Wp:B-spline].
    
:: Hermite
    Cubic Hermite curve that interpolates the odd control points, while even
    control points control the tangent at the previous interpolation
    point.
    See [Hermite spline|Wp:Cubic_Hermite_spline].
