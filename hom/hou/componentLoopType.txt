@values

:: Partial
    A partial loop connects the components provided in a path with each input
    component acting as a way-point on the path. The loop will always start
    with the first provided component and end with the last.

:: Extended
    An extended loop is always created from just two components (or possibly
    one edge component). It finds a path between these two components, then
    extends that path at both ends.  It extends each direction until it either
    hits a boundary in the geometry, or finds its way back to the existing path.
    Often the resulting path will neither start with the start component or end
    with the end component.

:: Closed
    A closed loop is always created from just two components (or possibly one
    edge component). It always tries to find a path the goes from the starting
    component, passes through the end component, and then continues on looking
    for a path back to the starting component. The paths returned will
    generally both start and end with the starting component.
