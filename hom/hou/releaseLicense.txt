"""Release the currently held Houdini license."""

:usage: `releaseLicense()`

When you import the hou module into a Python shell, it will acquire a
Houdini license.  This function exists so you can release that license
when you're done using the hou module.  This way, you can have a long
running Python script that periodically uses Houdini without having to
hold a Houdini license for the entire duration of the script.

After you release the license, it will automatically be reacquired when
you access functions and objects from the hou module.
