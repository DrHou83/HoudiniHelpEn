"""The base class for all visible elements within a network."""

This class has no methods, and only exists as a base class for
[Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem] and [Hom:Hou.NodeConnection], both of which are
visible in the network editor, but which have no real meaningful base class.
By providing a common base class, items of these two types can be passed in or
returned from [Hom:hou.NetworkEditor] functions.

@methods

::`networkItemType(self)` -> [Hom:hou.networkItemType]:
    #cppname: HOM_Node::networkItemType
    Return an enum value indicating what type of network item is represented
    by this object. This value is equivalent to using the `isinstance` built in
    Python function with the matching class
    (for example [Hom:hou.networkItemType#Connection] is equivalent to
    [Hom:hou.NodeConnection]).
