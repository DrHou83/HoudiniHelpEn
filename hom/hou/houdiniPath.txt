"""Return the contents of the Houdini path as a tuple of strings."""

:usage: `houdiniPath(path_variable = None)` -> tuple of strings

This method returns an ordered list of path components of the Houdini Path.
The Houdini Path is used when searching for various files like otls, shelf
tools, preferences, desktops, icons, etc.  By adjusting the `HOUDINI_PATH`
environment variable, you can add entries to the path that are specific to the
current user, job, or studio.

By default the components of the HOUDINI_PATH variable are returned.  If the
path_variable passed in refers to another well-known Houdini path, the
components of that search path are returned instead.  For example
`houdiniPath("HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH")`

See the output of `hconfig -ap` for more information on the current paths and
their values.
