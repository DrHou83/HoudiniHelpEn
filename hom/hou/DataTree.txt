@methods

::`treeTypes(self)` -> `tuple` of `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_DataTree::treeTypes
    Returns a tuple of strings that represent the different tree types that
    can be shown in the Data Tree pane.

::`treeType(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_DataTree::treeType
    Returns the current tree type being shown in the Data Tree. This function
    may return an empty string if no tree type has been chosen yet.

::`setTreeType(self, tree_type)` -> `bool`:
    #cppname: HOM_DataTree::setTreeType
    Changes the tree type being displayed in the Data Tree. Valid values are
    any strings returned by the `treeTypes` function. Returns True if the tree
    type was successfully changed, otherwise False.

::`currentPath(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_DataTree::currentPath
    Returns the path to the current node in the tree.

::`clearCurrentPath(self)` -> `str`:
    #cppname: HOM_DataTree::clearCurrentPath
    Clears the node(s) currently selected in the tree.

::`setCurrentPath(self, path, multi=False, index=-1)`:
    #cppname: HOM_DataTree::setCurrentPath
    Sets the currently selected node in the tree. If the provided path does
    not match a node in the tree, the tree will still attempt to set the
    current node to the best possible match of the provided path.

    If multi is set to True, the previous selection will not be cleared
    before selecting the new the node. This allows multiple nodes to be 
    selected in the tree.

::`setCurrentPaths(self, paths, expand)`:
    #cppname: HOM_DataTree::setCurrentPaths
    Selects mutliple nodes in the data tree based on the array of paths
    passed in. If the `expand` flag is set to True the tree nodes will be
    expanded after selection.

::`setCurrentNodeExpanded(self, expanded)`:
    #cppname: HOM_DataTree::setCurrentNodeExpanded
    Sets the expanded state of the currently selected node in the tree. If there
    is no selected node the method has no effect on the tree.

::`setTreeExpanded(self, expanded)`:
    #cppname: HOM_DataTree::setTreeExpanded
    Recursively sets the expanded state of the entire data tree.
