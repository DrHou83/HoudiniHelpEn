"""The quality of shadows produced in the viewport"""

The viewport renderer can do various amounts of shadowmap sampling to produce a higher quality result. 

@values

::hou.viewportShadowQuality.Point: 
    Area lights are treated as point lights when generating and sampling shadow maps. This is the fastest option.
    
::hou.viewportShadowQuality.PointAA: 
    Do some antialiasing of shadow edges. Treat area lights as point lights when generating and sampling shadow maps.

::hou.viewportShadowQuality.Area: 
    Area lights generate multiple shadow maps which are sampled to generate an approximation of a blurred shadow from an area source.
   
::hou.viewportShadowQuality.AreaAA: 
    Area lights generate multiple maps and antialias the shadow lookups.
