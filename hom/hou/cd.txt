= hou.cd =

#type: homfunction
#cppname: hom::cd
#group: nodes

"""Change the current node. Houdini has one current node, analogous to a
current directory in a file system. If a relative path is given, it is
relative to the node returned by hou.pwd()."""

:usage: `cd(path)`

If no node exists at the path, this function raises hou.OperationFailed.

Even though, when called from a parameter's expression, hou.pwd()
returns the node containing the parameter and not Houdini's current
node, hou.cd() will always change the current node.

This function will raise hou.NotAvailable if you call it from MPlay.
