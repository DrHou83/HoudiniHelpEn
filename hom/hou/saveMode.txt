@values

:: Text
    Save in an ASCII format that is friendly to version control and can be
    viewed and edited as plain text.  This format is compatible with Houdini 16
    and above only and is only available with a full commercial license.

:: Binary
    Traditional binary hip file format.  This is both smaller and more
    performant than the text format.
