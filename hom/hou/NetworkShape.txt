"""The base class for extra shapes that can be drawn into a network editor."""

The network editor pane can be instructed to draw additional shapes to either
the main canvas, or to the overlay area of the pane (drawn on top of the
actual network). Each element that is drawn is described as a subclass of this
`NetworkShape` base class, then passed to the network editor through either
the [Hom:hou.NetworkEditor#setShapes] or
[Hom:hou.NetworkEditor#setOverlayShapes] methods.
