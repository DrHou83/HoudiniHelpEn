    `selectedItems(include_hidden=False)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem]

If `include_hidden` is False, hidden nodes will not in the result, even if
they are selected. See [Hom:hou.Node#isHidden] for more information about
hidden nodes. Other item types do not support hiding and so are unaffected
by the value of this parameter.

The following example will print the positions of all selected items:
{{{
#!python
for n in hou.selectedItems():
    print n.position()
}}}
