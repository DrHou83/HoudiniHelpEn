:usage: `setMaxThreads(max_threads)`

When Houdini/hython is started, it uses all available processors on 
the machine for multi-threaded processing, unless overridden by the
`-j` command line option.

This function allows dynamically adjusting this setting at run-time.

Note that this function may only be called from the main thread.
If called from an expression that gets evaluated in a multi-threaded 
context, or during other processing, it will throw an exception.
