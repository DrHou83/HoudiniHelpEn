#type: homfunction

#group: nodes

"""Return a list of all selected nodes."""

:usage:
    `selectedNodes(include_hidden=False)` -> `tuple` of [Hom:hou.Node]

Returns a sequence of [Hom:hou.Node] objects representing the nodes that are currently selected.

{{{
#!python
print("The following nodes are currently selected:")
for node in hou.selectedNodes():
    print(node.path())
}}}

The last selected item has special meaning in Houdini: it controls what network unpinned panes focus on.

{{{
#!python
selected = hou.selectedNodes()
# In Python, a negative index counts from the end
print("Following:", selected[-1])
}}}

`include_hidden`:
    Normally, hidden nodes will not be included in the results, even if they are selected. Use `include_hidden=True` to get the selected hidden nodes as well. See [Hom:hou.Node#isHidden] for more information about hidden nodes.
