#type: homfunction

"""Clears the selected state for all nodes, network boxes, and other subclasses
of hou.NetworkMovableItem in the Houdini session."""

:usage: `clearAllSelected()`

This function is equivalent to traversing the node hierarchy and calling
`setSelected(False)` on every [Hom:hou.NetworkMovableItem] in the scene, but
operates much much faster.

This function will raise hou.NotAvailable if you call it from MPlay.
