"""Return the path to the Houdini directory in your $HOME directory."""

:usage: `homeHoudiniDirectory()` -> str

Return the directory in your `$HOME` directory where Houdini stores user-specific
settings.  On many platforms, this directory is `$HOME/houdiniX.Y`, where `X`
is the Houdini major version and `Y` is the minor version.  Note that on the
Mac, though, this directory might be in a different location.

See [Hom:hou.houdiniPath] for more information about how Houdini searches for
files.
