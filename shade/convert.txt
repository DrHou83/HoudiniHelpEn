= Converting image files =

== Overview ==

Houdini can handle most image formats, but in general you should use Houdini's image format (`.pic` or `.rat`) or OpenEXR format for textures. Those formats have additional features such as tiled loading that can save time and/or memory.


== How to ==

:task:Convert an image using MPlay:
    # Choose __Render > MPlay > Load disk files__ and pick the file you want to convert.
    
    # In Mplay, choose __File > Save frame as__. Save the image with a filename ending with the file extension of the new format.

:task:Convert an image from the command line:
    In a Houdini shell, use the [iconvert|/ref/utils/iconvert] command-line utility to convert images between formats. For example:
    
    {{{
    #!sh
    iconvert butterfly.pic butterfly.rat
    }}}
    
    You can type `iconvert` alone on the command line to see the list of supported formats. The [iinfo|/ref/utils/iinfo] command will print information about image files.

:task:Convert an image using a compositing network:
    # Choose __File > Import > Image__ and pick the image you want to convert.
    
        This will create a new compositing network with a [File compositing node|Node:cop/file] that loads the image.
    
    * If you want to convert the file procedurally (so you can run the conversion as part of a render network), choose __Render > Create render node > Other output nodes > Composite__ and set it to render the output of the compositing network.
    
    * If you just want to convert the file once, right-click the File compositing node and choose __Save image__. Save the image with a filename ending with the file extension of the new format.
