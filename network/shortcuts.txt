TIP:
    Look through the menus to discover network editor functionality and keyboard equivalents.


== View keys ==

Key ||
    #width: 120px
    Alternate ||
        #width: 120px;
        Description ||

((Space + LMB)) |
    ((MMB)) |
        Pan

((Space + RMB)) |
    ((mouse_wheel)) |
        Zoom

((H)) |
    |
        Pan and zoom to show all nodes

((G)) |
    |
        Pan and zoom to show the selected nodes


== Adding to the network ==

+(fa-caret-right) [More info|nodes]

Key ||
    #width: 240px
    Description ||

((Tab)) |
    Add a node to the current network from a menu.
    
((=)) |
    Add a File node (if available in the current network).

((Shift + O)) |
    Add a [network box|organize#netbox] to the current network. If any nodes are selected, they are added to the box.

((Shift + P)) |
    Add a [sticky note|organize#notes] to the current network.


== Wiring ==

+(fa-caret-right) [More info|wire]

Key ||
    #width: 240px
    Description ||
    
((LMB)) on connector |
    Drag between two connectors, or click one connector and then the other, to wire nodes together.

((RMB)) on connector |
    Insert a new node before any currently connected nodes.

((MMB)) on connector |
    Branch a new node off the connector.

((Alt + LMB)) on node |
    Show a menu of connectors to start wiring from. This can be useful when you're too zoomed out to hit the connectors.

((Y)) |
    Hold ((Y)) and drag across wires to cut (disconnect) them.

Shake node |
    Disconnect from any wires.

((Alt + LMB)) on wire |
    Add [dot|wire#dots].

    You can also ((Alt))-click while drawing a wire to insert a dot "on the fly".

((Alt + LMB)) on dot |
    [Pin/unpin|wire#dots] the dot.
    
    You can also ((Ctrl + Alt))-click while drawing a wire to insert a pinned dot "on the fly".

((8)) while dropping node |
    Holding ((8)) temporarily disables wiring the node in if you drop the node on a wire. This lets you drop a node without worrying about accidentally rewiring it if there is an existing wire in the same area.
    
    If you've turned off __Tools > Allow dropping nodes on wires__, then holding ((8)) temporarily _enables_ dropping a node onto a wire to wire it in.


== Tools ==

    Description ||

((P)) |
    Toggle a floating parameter editor pane in the top right corner of the network.

((Shift + W)) |
    Toggle a tree view of the complete network hierarchy on the left of the network.

((O)) |
    Toggle the [network overview|navigate#overview] in the bottom left corner of the network.

((C)) |
    Toggle the [color palette|organize#custom] in the bottom right corner of the network.

((Z)) |

        Double-click a node to go inside, or select it and press ((Enter)).

((U)) |
    |
        Press ((U)) to go up a level.

((Ctrl)) + <<N>> |
    |
        Press ((Ctrl)) and a number from 1-5 to set a quick mark.

    |
        Press ((Shift)) and a number from 1-5 to return a set quick mark.

((`)) (backtick) |
    |
        Go back to the previous view. This lets you quickly switch back and forth between two views, possibly in different networks.

((PgUp)) |
    |
        Select the node upstream (connected to the input) of the currently selected node.

((PgUp)) |
    |
        Select the node downstream (connected to the output) of the currently selected node.

((Shift + PgUp)) |
    |
        Select the previous sibling node of the currently selected node.

((Shift + PgDn)) |
    |
        Select the next sibling node of the currently selected node.


== Working with nodes ==

+(fa-caret-right) [More info|nodes#info]

Key ||
    #width: 240px
    Description ||

((MMB)) |
    Press ((MMB)) on a node to show the [node info window|nodes#info] while you hold the button down. This is a quick way to glance at the information in the info window.

((Shift + MMB)) |
    Press ((Shift + MMB)) on a node to show the node info window without cooking the node. This may be useful for nodes that take a long time to cook.

((Alt)) + drag node |
    Create a copy of the node.

((S)) + drag box selection |
    Holding ((S)) locks the drag to be a selection. This can be useful if there's not enough "empty" space to start a box selection without hitting something else.


== Laying out nodes ==
    // Note: have to indent this so the Include below doesn't get sucked under this heading.

    +(fa-caret-right) [More info|layout]

    Key ||
        #width: 240px
        Description ||
    
    Drag node + ((Space)) |
        When dragging a node, hold ((Space)) to lock the mouse pointer inside the network view. This lets you autoscroll long distances without worrying about the mouse pointer going outside the pane.

    ((A)) |
        Hold ((A)) and drag up/left on a node to automatically lay out the upstream nodes. Drag down/right to lay out the downstream nodes. If some nodes are selected, only those nodes are moved.

    ((Shift + A)) |
        Select the nodes to align, then hold ((Shift + A)) and drag on the node to align to. Drag left/right to align horizontally, or up/down to align vertically.

    ((Alt + A)) |
        Select the nodes to move, then hold ((Alt + A)) and drag left/right on a node. Drag left/right to distribute horizontally, or up/down to distribute vertically.
