"""How to move around the networks and move between networks."""

== Moving around the network ==

:task: Pan and zoom the network view:
    * Drag ((MMB)) to pan, or hold ((Space)) and drag ((LMB)).
        
    * Use ((mouse_wheel)) to zoom in and out. Or, hold ((Space)) and drag ((RMB)).
        
    * Press ((O)) to show a small
      representation of the current network in the corner. Clicking
      or dragging on this overview pans the view around the
      network.

:task: Automatically Pan and zoom to show all nodes:
    Right click the network background and choose __Viewing controls > Home all__, or press ((H)).

:task: Automatically Pan and zoom to show the selected nodes:
    Right click the network background and choose __Viewing controls > Home selected__, or press ((G)).

:task: Go inside a network node to see its contents:
    * Double-click the node.

    * Select the node and press ((I)) or ((Enter)).

    * ((RMB)) on an object in the viewer and
      choose __Edit Geometry__, __Edit subnetwork__, etc.

:task: Go up a level to the network above the current one:
    * Click the level in the path above the network view.
    
        ~~~ or ~~~
    
    * Press ((U)) in the network editor.

:task: Select the previous (input) or next (output) node in the current chain:
    Press ((PgUp)) or ((PgDn)).

:task: Find a specific node:
    See [finding nodes|find].

:task: Zoom to the start or end of a wire:
    If you see a wire, and want to zoom to the input or output, right-click the wire and choose __Frame input__ or __Frame output__.


== Framing ==

:task: Zoom out to show all nodes:
    In the network editor, choose __View > Zoom to show all__, or press ((H)).
    
:task: Zoom to show all selected nodes:
    In the network editor, choose __View > Zoom to show selected__, or press ((G)).


== Panning while dragging ==

* When dragging a node to move it in the network editor, you can automatically pan by holding the mouse near the edge of the network view without 

* Hold ((Space)) while dragging to lock the cursor inside the network view. This lets you drag large distances with autoscroll, without worrying about the mouse pointer going outside the view.


== Network overview == (overview)

:vimeo: Colors, shapes, and navigator
    #id: 204999971

The overview shows a small schematic view of the overall network in the bottom left corner of the network view. It lets you see where the current view is in relation to the overall network, and lets you quickly move the view by clicking in the overview.

You can control when the overview appears using the __Tools > Show overview__ menu items:

When needed:
    The overview only appears when the entire network doesn't fit in the view.

Always:
    Always show the overview.

Never:
    Don't show the overview.

By default, the overview is set to show "when needed".


== Quickmarks == (quick)

:vimeo: Quickmarks
    #id: 204582253

:col:
    "Quick marks" let you quickly set and return to lightweight, disposable network location "bookmarks". Unlike regular bookmarks (see below), you can use them as-needed and then override them or forget about them. They are not saved with the scene file.

:col:
    Each mark records the network [path|paths], view location, and zoom level. So you can use marks to switch back and forth between two different networks, or two different areas or nodes in the same network.

:task: Set a quick mark:
    Press ((Ctrl)) and ((1)), ((2)), ((3)), ((4)), or ((5)).
    
    On +(fa-apple) Mac, press ((Cmd)) and ((1)), ((2)), ((3)), ((4)), or ((5)).
    
:task: Return to a quick mark:
    Press ((1)), ((2)), ((3)), ((4)), or ((5)).

:task: Go back to the previous view:
    Press ((`)) (backtick).
    
    This lets you quickly switch back and forth between two views, possibly in different networks.


== Location history and bookmarks ==

:task: Go the previous or next network location viewed (like a browser):
    * Use the arrow buttons in the network editor toolbar.
    
        ~~~ or ~~~
        
    * Press ((Alt + Left)) or ((Alt + Right)).

:task: Use bookmarks:
    Click the history dropdown menu at the end of the path gadget at the top of the editor pane, and choose __Bookmarks__. You can use this menu to add new ones or edit existing ones. Once you add a bookmark it will appear in the history dropdown menu.
    
    These bookmarks are saved with the scene file, so you can use them to make a list commonly useful locations always available.
