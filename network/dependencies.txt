== Visualize dependencies in the network editor ==

:vimeo: Network editor dependencies
    #id: 205000294

You can visualize parameter references from one node to another (for example, an expression using [Exp:ch] to get the value of a parameter on another node) in the network editor. This can be useful to understand dependencies and look for external references when trying to create a self-contained asset.

:task: Show dependencies for all nodes:
    In the network editor, choose __View > Dependency links: for all nodes__.

:task: Show dependencies only when nodes are selected:
    In the network editor, choose __View > Dependency links: for selected nodes__.

* References to other nodes in the same network appear as pinkish-brown lines connecting nodes. Reference lines _to_ a node enter the node on the left. Reference lines _from_ a node leave from the right side of the node.

* References to nodes in other networks appear as clickable indicators showing incoming and outgoing reference counts. Click one of the indicators to open a menu that lets you jump to the referenced/referencing nodes.


== Get a list of dependencies for a node ==

Right-click a node in the network editor and choose __View dependencies__.

The window shows which parameters of the target are used by other nodes, and which parameters use values from other nodes.

Use the __View__ menu to choose whether to list parameters that depend on this node (Dependents) or references to other node in this node's parameters (References).

Houdini color-codes the parameter name in the dialog:

Black (normal):
    The parameter is referenced/dependent.

Grey:
    Ambiguous. The parameter _may_ be dependent, but the dependency checking isn't fine-grained enough to tell for sure. For example, dependency checking works at the parameter level, so Houdini might see a dependency on the Translate parameter, but not know if the dependency is in `tx`, `ty`, or `tz` (or all three).
    
Red:
    Circular reference. This node references a parameter on another node, and that node references this node.
    
Yellow:
    Ambiguous circular reference.
