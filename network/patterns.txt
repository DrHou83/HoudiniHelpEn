= Pattern matching in parameters =

"""An explanation of the special characters available in pattern-matching parameters."""

== String patterns ==

You can use string patterns anywhere an expression function needs a name (such as a parameter or node name) to match multiple things at once.

`*` |
    Matches any string.

`?` |
    Matches any single character.

`[<<chars>>]` |
    Matches any of the characters between the square brackets. This does *not* support character ranges using a hyphen (you *cannot* do `[a-z]`).

`^<<pattern>>` |
    Removes strings matching <<pattern>> from the previous match.

`@<<name>>` |
    Matches attribute, object group, channel group, and/or bundle (depending on context).

Examples:

`geo*` |
    Matches everything beginning with "geo".

`[gG]eo*` |
    Matches everything beginning with "geo" or "Geo".

`?eo*` |
    Matches everything that has any character followed by "eo" and then any number of characters.

`* ^geo1` |
    Matches everything except the string "geo1".

== Numeric patterns in the Group node ==

See [Group syntax|/model/groups#syntax].

== Notes ==

* Separate multiple patterns with spaces. Commas are not allowed as separator characters.
