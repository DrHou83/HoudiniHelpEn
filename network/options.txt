"""Guide to network editor options."""


== Overview ==

* Options you might have to change regularly are in the [network editor pane menus|menus].

* Options that affect how the network is drawn but are changed less often than the options in the __View__ menu go in the network editor's [display options dialog|#display].

* Options you usually set once to what you prefer are in the [preferences dialog|/ref/windows/mainprefs#net].


== Settings menus == (menus)

Look through the [View menu|menus#view_menu] and [Tools menu|menus#tools_menu] for commonly-used options that affect the network editor display and user interface.


== Wiring style == (wirestyles)

Houdini has different ways to drag the wires connecting nodes.

* You can switch between the available wiring styles using the __View > Change network wiring style__ menu item.

* You can set the default wiring style on the __Themes__ tab of the Display Options window (see below).

* The wiring style is saved in the subnetwork, so you can set up different networks with different styles that might be more appropriate for that network's layout.

== Display options == (display)

NOTE:
    #glyph: fa-floppy-o
    
    These options are saved per-[desktop|/basics/panes]. Open the [Icon:BUTTONS/layout] Desktop chooser and choose __Save current desktop__ to keep the current settings between sessions.

    // This content has to be indented so the heading doesn't snarf the includes after it

    Node size to show ring:
        Choose the maximum zoom level at which the node ring will appear. You can use the slider to set a size manually, or use the __Choose node size__ menu to set a preset size, including "never show the ring" or "always show the ring".

        To set an exact maximum zoom level, zoom the network so the nodes are the largest size you want the ring to appear at, then open the display options, click the __Choose node size__ action menu and choose "Current node size".

    Maximum node name width:
        Decrease this slider to have the network editor cut off the display of long node names in the network view.

    Long wire fading:
        Houdini fades the middle of long wires so wires across the network don't obscure everything they cross. This 

        Decrease this to lessen fading effect in the middle of long wires. Turn this slider all the way down to not fade long wires at all.

    Background image brightness:
        A global scale on [background image|organize#images] opacity. Turning this down fades all images into the background more.

    Grid spacing:
        Sets the spacing of the [grid|layout]. One distance unit in the network editor is roughly the width of a node.

=== Themes ===

Wire style for new networks:
    Sets the default [wiring style|#wirestyles] used for new subnetworks. You can change the wiring style of a subnetwork using __View > Change network wiring style__.

Default node colors:
    You can assign default colors per-node-type in the network editor. This menu lets you save the default colors you've set in network editor as a "theme", and switch between themes. See [shape and color themes|organize#themes] for more information.
    
    Houdini comes with two color themes already. "Default" colors some of the node types you often want to be able to pick out in a network at a glance. "No colors" doesn't have any custom colors (this can be useful as a starting point for your own theme).

Default node shapes:
    You can assign default node shapes per-node-type in the network editor. This menu lets you save the default shapes you've set in network editor as a "theme", and switch between themes. See [shape and color themes|organize#themes] for more information.

    Houdini comes with three shape themes already. "Default" gives custom shapes to some node types you often want to be able to pick out in a network at a glance. "Flair" is the same as "Default" but uses slightly more charming shapes for Light and Bone. "No shapes" doesn't have any custom shapes (this can be useful as a starting point for your own theme).

TIP:
    You can turn off display of custom node shapes by turning off __View > Show custom node shapes__ in the network editor.
