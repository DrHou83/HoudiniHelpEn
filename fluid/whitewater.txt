= Whitewater =

The [Whitewater|/shelf/whitewater] tool on the __Particle Fluids__ shelf creates spray, foam, and churn based on an underlying FLIP fluid simulation. It sets up the [source|Node:sop/whitewatersource] and [solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] for a whitewater simulation. Whitewater emission particles are created from a source  [FLIP|/shelf/flipfluidfromobject] or [liquid|/shelf/liquidbox] simulation based on several criteria including fluid acceleration, curvature, and vorticity. The simulation uses these emission particles and volumes from the fluid simulations as sources for simulating whitewater with foam, spray and bubble particles.

TIP:
        Do not try to set up a whitewater simulation from scratch.
        
For more information on how the tool sets up the network, see the [Whitewater|/shelf/whitewater] shelf help.

== How to animate a wave tank with whitewater ==

This tutorial explains how to get a nice looking wave tank in the viewport and flipbook. This is useful to see how the waves will move and where whitewater will be created.

# Press ((D)) to open the [Display Options|/ref/windows/displayopts_3d] dialog.

# On the __Geometry__ tab, turn off the __Display Sprites__ checkbox.

# Create a [Icon:SHELF/wave_tank][Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank] using the tool on the __Oceans__ shelf tab.

# On the `wavetank` node, lower the __Particle Separation__ value to `0.10` or `0.07`. This will create a better looking wave tank.

# Navigate back to the OBJ level and click the [Whitewater|/shelf/whitewater] tool on the __Oceans__ shelf tab. Select the tank when prompted to add whitewater to the existing network.

# On the __Guide__ tab of the [Whitewater Object|Node:dop/whitewaterobject], turn on the __Color Particles By Type__ checkbox. This will cause the foam particles to be displayed white, the spray particles to be displayed green, and the bubbles to be displayed red.

        NOTE:
                You can turn off the display red and green particles by diving into the [Icon:SHELF/whitewater][Whitewater Solver|Node:dop/whitewatersolver] and turning off the __Enable Spray__ checkbox on the __Spray__ tab, and __Enable Bubbles__ checkbox on the __Bubbles__ tab. 
        
# Stay inside the `whitewater_sim` node and play your scene. If you leave the `whitewater_sim` node the particles will appear black.
