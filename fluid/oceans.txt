== Overview ==

The [Ocean shelf tab|/shelf/oceans] contains tools for creating ocean simulations.

The [Icon:SHELF/ocean_small][Small Ocean|/shelf/smallocean] tool is used for creating an ocean like surface. However, it is not a simulation, it is a deformer that does not use DOPs at all. You can scrub through the timeline and watch the ocean evolve without any simulation. For a simulated ocean, use the [Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank] tool.

The [Icon:SHELF/ocean_large][Large Ocean|/shelf/largeocean] tool is used for creating a large ocean with no repeating tiles even over very large distances. However, it is not a simulation, it is a deformer that does not use DOPs at all. You can scrub through the timeline and watch the ocean evolve without any simulation. For a simulated ocean, use the [Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank] tool.

The [Icon:SHELF/guided_ocean_layer][Guided Ocean Layer|/shelf/guidedoceanlayer] tool creates a guided FLIP simulation of a thin particle layer on top of an ocean surface. The particles are initialized with ocean velocities. The ocean surface at a specified depth acts as a collision layer underneath the particles, allowing the particles to closely match the ocean waves. A boundary layer of particles suppresses reflections at the edge of the tank, contributes ocean velocities back to the simulation, and maintains the water volume level to match the ocean. The FLIP Simulation uses a guiding volume approach to maintain ocean velocities through the simulation.

The [Icon:SHELF/wave_tank][Wave Tank|/shelf/wavetank] tool creates a FLIP tank simulation with particles initialized from an ocean surface with velocities. A boundary layer of particles suppresses reflections at the edge of the tank, contributes ocean velocities back to the simulation, and maintains the water volume level to match the ocean.

The [Icon:SHELF/beach_tank][Beach Tank|/shelf/beachtank] tool creates a FLIP tank simulation of waves breaking on a beach or other shallow water terrain. This tool is similar to the Wave Tank, except it enables an option to ramp down ocean velocities in a certain direction across the length of the tank. Reducing the velocities allow the ocean waves to break naturally as the water get shallower.

The [Icon:SHELF/flat_tank][Flat Tank|/shelf/flattank] tool creates a FLIP tank simulation of a flat tank of particles similar to the FLIP Tank tool, but with the addition of a boundary layer of particles that helps suppress reflections at the edge of the tank and maintain the water level over time. The boundary layer also allows the tank to track a moving object, simulating only the area around the object.
