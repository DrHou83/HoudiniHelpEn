= Particle fluid surfacing and rendering =

To allow you to render the particle fluid, Houdini must "surface" the fluid. That is, build a polygonal surface based on the positions of the particles in the fluid.

When you use the shelf tools to set up a particle fluid network, the tools automatically set up a new Geometry object containing the result surface from the fluid simulation (by default called `particle_fluid` or `sculpted_particle_fluid` depending on the tool).

The `particle_fluid` object contains a node importing the particle fluid visualization, and nodes to import and convert the particles into a surface. The [DOP Import node|Node:sop/dopimport] with the visualization has the _display flag_ (blue circle), so it is used for the viewport. The [Particle Fluid Surface node|Node:sop/particlefluidsurface] that creates the surface has the _render flag_ (purple circle) so it is used when you render. You can click the display flag on the Particle Fluid Surface to view the surface in the viewport instead of the particles.

TIP:
    If the surface is too rough, you can try connecting a [Peak surface node|Node:sop/peak] to the Particle Fluid Surface output to shrink the surface inward, and then add a [Smooth node|Node:sop/smooth].

TIP:
    You can clip the fluid surface using any container and collision geometry, to prevent interpenetration. Import the container geometry into the fluid surfacing object, use an [IsoOffset node|Node:sop/isooffset] to convert it to an SDF (set __Output type__ to "SDF Volume" and use the __Uniform sampling__ parameter to control the resolution). Then, connect the IsoOffset to the _second_ input of the Particle Fluid Surface node. On the Particle Fluid Surface node, click the __Collision Volumes__ tab and turn on __Subtract Collision Volumes__. You can use this to subtract any geometry from the surface, for example to add air bubbles.
