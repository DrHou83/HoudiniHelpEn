"""Viscous fluids are FLIP simulations that use a temperature attribute to drive viscosity."""

== Overview ==

The tools on Viscous Fluids shelf set up FLIP simulations, which react to temperature changes. The viscous fluid tools set up a temperature attribute that drives the viscosity. For example, as the temperature of lava cools, so does the viscosity.

== Melt Object vs Lava From Object ==

The [Melt Object|/shelf/meltobject] and [Lava From Object|/shelf/lavafromobject] tools are very similar, as they both turn geometry objects into a particle fluids with a temperature attribute that affects viscosity. The main difference is that the [Melt Object|/shelf/meltobject] tool doesn't apply any shader. The [Lava From Object|/shelf/lavafromobject] assigns a shader to get a basic glowing lava look.

You would typically want to use [Melt Object|/shelf/meltobject] whenever you have an object that will change state over time. For example, a warm chocolate bunny that would slump over and then cool off and become solid. Whereas the [Lava From Object|/shelf/lavafromobject] is typically used for simulating lava, since it has the lava shader applied.

Both of these tools are affected by the __Temperature__ parameter on the __Physical__ tab of the [FLIP Object|Node:dop/flipobject]. This parameter sets the initial temperature of the object. The default value is 0.5, which will cause it to melt immediately since the object starts off quite warm. A higher value will give you very hot, free-flowing liquid which cools over time and a lower value would give you cool, highly viscous fluid that heats up and melts.

== Heat Within Object vs Cool Within Object ==(heatvscool)

    The [Heat Within Object|/shelf/heatwithinobject] and [Cool Within Object|/shelf/coolwithinobject] tools are very similar. The main difference is that the heating tool has a high __Increase Rate__ meaning that melting objects will heat up, and the cooling tool has a high __Decrease Rate__ meaning that objects will cool off quickly.
    
    The __Increase/Decrease Rate__ parameters can be found on the [POP Attribute from Volume|Node:dop/popattribfromvolume] node, and work similar to the way the __Temperature Diffusion__ parameters on the [Gas Temperature Update|Node:dop/gastemperatureupdate] node work. They control how quickly the temperature from your heated or cooled object will affect your viscous fluid.
