= MPlay preferences window =

In MPlay, choose __Windows > Preferences__ to show the global
preferences window.

Frame Range:
    The global frame range.
Step:
    The global frame step. A step of 1 plays every frame, 2 plays every
    other frame, 3 plays every 3rd frame, and so on.
Frame Rate:
    The global rate at which sequences play back (in frames per
    second).
Change rate of all sequences:
    When the __Frame Rate__ field above is changed, copy the rate to all
    loaded sequences.
Real Time:
    MPlay will attempt to play the sequence back as closely to realtime
    as possible. (It may not do realtime playback on the first pass if
    disk access is not fast enough to load images in realtime.)
Play Mode:
    Sets the playbar mode to Loop, Play Once, or Zig-Zag.
Load Components:
    Normally MPlay loads color and alpha planes, if present. However,
    you can conserve memory can be loading the color components only.
    This applies to all RGBA image formats. The Houdini PIC format loads
    planes on demand, so this setting does not affect PIC sequences.
Missing Frames:
    Specifies the method for replacing missing frames.

    Use Nearest Frame:
        Shows the closest frame in time.
    Use Previous Frame:
        Shows the last valid frame before the missing frame.
    Use Next Frame:
        Shows the next valid frame after the missing frame.
    Use Black Frame:
        Shows black.
        
Convert from 10bit Log:
    If this option is turned on, the cineon files which are stored in logarithmic format are converted to linear space. If this option is turned off, the files remain in log space.
    
LUT File:
    The transform from log to linear is defined in an external LUT file.
    
White point:
    The cineon white point value, if a LUT is not used. This parameter affects the overall brightness. 
    
Film gamma:
    The gamma curve to apply, if a LUT is not used. This parameter affects the midtones.
