= Sequence List =

Choose __Windows > Sequence List__ to open the sequence list window.

The sequence list manager shows all the current sequences, their frame
range, rate and step, with controls to manipulate the sequences.

NOTE:
    If a  [background
    image|/ref/views/imgview#ref_win_displayopts_cop_bg]  is loaded,
    it appears as the last image.

From left to right, the controls are:

Remove Sequence:
    Removes the entire sequence from MPlay.
Reorder Sequence:
    Moves the sequence up in the sequence list.
Make this the Current Sequence:
    Selects this sequence to be shown in the current viewport. The current viewport, when there are more than one, is outlined in green with a green label.
Diff against this Sequence:
    When using the Diff feature of MPlay, this selects the 2nd sequence to compare the first sequence to. You can also compare a sequence to itself, with a frame offset.
Sequences: 
    This is an information-only label showing the various image sequences that are loaded.
Reload Sequence:
    Reloads all images in the sequence.
Save Sequence:
    Lets you to save all or part of the sequence.
Lock Frame Range:
    Manually overrides the frame range of the sequence.
Frame Range:
    The frame range of the sequence. If __Lock Frame Range__ is on, you
    can enter a new frame range for the sequence.
Fit Frame Range to This Sequence:
    Sets the global frame range to the current frame range of this
    sequence.
Override Start Frame:
    Shifts the sequence to a new start frame. This is useful for
    aligning the sequence in time with different frame ranges.
Start Frame:
    The current start frame of the sequence.
FPS:
    The frame rate of the sequence. Normally you would change the frame
    rate of MPlay to change the frame rate, however this control lets
    you compare two sequences of different rates.
Step:
    The frame step of the sequence. A step of 1 shows every frame.
Extend:
    Specifies how the sequence is extended outside its frame range -
    Black frames, Cycle, Mirror or Hold.
Aspect:
    This shows the pixel aspect ratio of the image. Most images have square (1:1) pixels. Other images can have rectangular pixels like 2:1 (aspect = 2) or 1.09:1 (1.09). This will modify how the image is shown by stretching (aspect > 1) or squashing (aspect < 1) it horizontally, so that the display is a more accurate representation.
Flip Image:
    Flips all images in the sequence vertically.
Remove Black Frames:
    Skips missing frames in the sequence. This will make any frames
    after missing frames out of synch with their actual frame number,
    but prevents black frames from appearing during playback.

    This only has an effect if you started MPlay from the command line
    with  [the -g option|mplay_options] .
