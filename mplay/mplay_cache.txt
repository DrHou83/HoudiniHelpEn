= Load MPlay images into memory to improve playback (caching) =

MPlay starts with a very large image cache. As images are loaded off
disk, MPlay caches them in memory.

To have MPlay attempt to cache all the images in all loaded sequences,
choose __Image > Cache All__. This will adjust the cache size to
fit all the images, if possible. The process will stop if the cache
exceeds available memory.

To explicitly set the cache size, choose __Windows > Display Options__ and
click the __Memory__ tab.
