= Use multiple viewports in MPlay =

MPlay supports up to 16 viewports, laid out 4x4, for both the Image and
Graph viewers (Timeline displays all the sequences in one viewport).
Each viewport can display a different sequence, and more than one
viewport can show the same sequence, if desired.

The viewport layout determines how many viewports can be seen at once.
You can set the number of rows and columns of viewports using the layout
menu in the main bar.

The viewport layout tries to minimize the number of viewports, based on
the number of sequences loaded. So if you have 2 sequences and a layout
of 2x2, you'll get a layout of 2x1, since the other two viewports would
be blank. (You can force your viewport layout using the Display Options,
__Viewport__ tab, 'Show All Viewports Always').

The viewport layout can also be specified on the command line using the
`-V <<x>> <<y>> ` option.

== Selecting Viewports ==

    MPlay's controls normally work on all viewports. However, you can
    also set them on a per-viewport basis.

    Viewports are linked together by default. You can unlink them by
    pressing ((V)). Now, only the current viewport (outlined and labeled
    in green) will be affected by the viewport controls. The current
    viewport can be changed by moving the mouse into the desired
    viewport and ((LMB)) clicking it, or pressing ((X)).

    Pressing ((V)) again will relink the viewports. The viewports'
    labels will turn yellow to indicate they are linked.

== Multiple Viewports in Single Mode ==

    Multiple viewports can be displayed in either split or single mode.
    Split mode is the default, which shows you all the viewports. Single
    mode shows one viewport, and allows you to tab between the
    sequences.

    To toggle between split and single mode, press ((T)).

    Single mode has a strip of tabs along the bottom of the viewport (if
    more than 1 sequence is loaded). Clicking on a Sequence's tab will
    switch to that sequence.

    You can also use the tab strip to compare one image to another.
    ((Shift + LMB)) click the sequence to compare to.
    ((Shift + LMB)) click the sequence again to turn the diff off.

    You can also reorder sequences in the tab by dragging a sequence
    over another tab. The sequences will be swapped.

    Finally, you can remove a sequence by dragging the tab straight up
    until the cursor turns into an 'X'.
