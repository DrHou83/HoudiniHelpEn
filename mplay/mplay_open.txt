= Open Images in MPlay =

MPlay loads files into image sequences. Each sequence has a start frame,
end frame, and playback rate. You can view multiple sequences at once in
MPlay.

You can open a single image in MPlay or a sequence based on numbered
filenames.

:task:Start MPlay from the command line:
    * When you start MPlay from the command line, the files you pass
      as arguments are loaded as a sequence. However, if a filename
      includes `$F`, MPlay treats that filename as a pattern and
      loads it as a separate sequence.

:task:Open a sequence:
    * Choose __File > Open__ to discard any sequences currently open
      and open a new sequence.

      Choose __File > Merge__ to open a new sequence and add it to
      the existing sequences. See  [how to work with multiple open
      sequences|mplay_sequence_dialog] .

      The  [open dialog|mplay_open_dialog]  includes extra controls
      for loading sub-sequences, reducing image sizes as you load,
      flipping images, etc.

:task:Append a sequence from disk to an open sequence:
    * In MPlay, choose __File > Append Sequence__ or __File > Prepend
      Sequence__.

:task:Render into an MPlay window:
    * In the parameter editor of the [render output driver|/nodes/out/], click the __Render__ button. You can also click the [Icon:NETWORKS/rop] icon located at the bottom-left corner of the viewer.

    Set options for how Houdini renders to MPlay:
        # To show options for rendering to MPlay, set __Output picture__
          to `ip`, then click the arrow button to the right of the
          __Format__ parameter (under __Output picture__).

        # __Re-render to__ controls whether a new render sends frames to
          the current render sequence, or a new sequence. If you render
          multiple frames are rendered and this is set to "New
          Sequence", a new sequence is only created on the first frame.

        # __Frame Numbering__ controls how frames are placed within the
          sequence. "Append Frames to Sequence" puts the frame after the
          last frame in the sequence. "Match Houdini Frame Numbers" puts
          frames in the Houdini frame that they originate from,
          overwriting any frame there. "Append" is useful for constantly
          re-rendering the same frame with minor tweaks; you will have a
          history of that frame. "Match" is useful for preserving the
          frame numbers, or re-rendering portions of the animation.

        # __Tile Rendering Order__ controls the order in which Houdini
          renders the tiles of the image.

        # You can apply gamma and LUT to rendered images globally or per
          output driver.

          To set the render gamma/LUT globally, in Houdini choose
          __Settings > Colors__, click __Color Correction__. Change the
          gamma and/or LUT, and then click __Apply__ beside Interactive
          Renders (ip).

          To set the render gamma/LUT locally for an output driver
          (ROP), open the options and set the __Display gamma__ and
          __Display LUT__.

        # See  [how to control the rendering in the MPlay
          window|mplay_control] .

NOTE:
    You can load a sequence as a background which will be visible
    through the transparent pixels of the current playing sequence.
    Choose __Windows > Display Options__ and click the __Background__
    tab.

NOTE:
    MPlay automatically fits its size to the images when you open them
    from the command line. If you use __File > Open__ from within MPlay,
    it does not automatically adjust the window size. Press ((F)) to
    adjust the size manually.
