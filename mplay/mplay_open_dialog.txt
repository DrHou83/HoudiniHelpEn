= MPlay file open dialog =

The MPlay file open dialog has extra controls for opening image
sequences:

Image Size menu:
    You can load sequences at natural, 75%, 66%, 50%, 33%, 25%, or
    Custom resolution. This lets you work with smaller, faster
    representations of very large images.
Lock Image Size:
    Selecting sequences does not overwrite the custom image size fields
    (__Image Size > Custom__). Normally the fields automatically update
    with the resolution of the selected sequence.
Single Image / Image Sequence Menu:
    Sequences are normally interpreted as Single Images if there is no
    frame number in the filename, otherwise they are interpreted as an
    Image Sequence. This menu allows you to manually choose which type
    to open.
Frame Range and Step :
    The frame range and frame step to load from a sequence. You can use
    this to load a subrange of a sequence, and/or every <<n>>th frame,
    to save space.
Lock Frame Range :
    The Frame Range fields do automatically update when you select a
    sequence.
Frame Rate:
    Frame rate of the selected sequence. The initial value is Houdini's
    global frame rate.
Flip Image Vertically :
    Flips loaded images vertically.
Allow Caching of This Sequence:
    Caches the sequence for quicker playback.
