    Hide Blank Viewports:   
        If this option is turned on, blank viewports are hidden.
User Interface:
    Fullscreen:
        Maximizes MPlay's viewports to the size of the desktop, so that only the viewports are visible. Labels and guides are temporarily turned off. Press ((Ctrl + F)) or ((Esc)) to return to the MPlay window.
    Hide Extra UI:
        Toggles off all interface bars but the playbar. This option is also accessible through the ((RMB)) menu (as the menu bar won't be displayed).
    Menubar:
        Toggles the menu bar on or off.
    Main bar:
        Toggles the Main Bar on or off. The main bar lies above the viewports and contains mostly viewport management controls.
    Display bar:
        Toggles the Display Bar on or off. The display bar is along the right side of the viewports.    
    Image Controls:
        Toggles the Image Controls on or off. It contains the color correction controls for the Image view, Preview rate for the Timeline, and Graph selection for the Graph view.

    Help Tips:
        If on, a help tag will appear when the mouse is held over an interface gadget for a short period of time.

Listen for Flipbooks:
    MPlay is connected to Houdini and will show flipbooks when you click the [Icon:TOOLS/flipbook] flipbook icon in Houdini.

    Jump to next frame.
Realtime:
    If this option is turned on, MPlay will attempt to play the sequence back as closely to realtime as possible. (It may not do realtime playback on the first pass if disk access is not fast enough to load images in realtime.)

    Sets the playbar mode to Loop, Play Once, or Zig-Zag.
Set Houdini Frame:
    Syncs Houdini to the MPlay's current frame on the playbar.
Export Blocking:

== Image menu ==

Reload Sequence:

Compare Images:
    Turns on diffing. This allows you to compare one image to another through a variety of methods, such as differencing, blending, and wiping.

    Causes a small inspection window to pop-up where the mouse is which shows you the values of the pixel under the cursor as well as its location in the image.
Clear Cache:
    Removes all cached images.
Cache All:
    Load all images into the cache. The cache limit will be increased to
    hold all the images, unless the limit would be beyond the capability
    of the system (in which case, pre-caching will stop prematurely).
Add Frame Comment:
    Allows you to add a simple text comment to the currently displayed frame. This comment will be saved with the image if the image format supports comments.
