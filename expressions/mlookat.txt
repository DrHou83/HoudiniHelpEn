"""Computes the transformation matrix of a lookat from one vector to another."""

:usage: `mlookat(<<v1>>, <<v2>>)`

Computes a transform matrix specifying a lookat from vector <<v1>> to
the vector <<v2>>.

The vectors are converted to 3 vectors for
this computation. The resulting matrix will be a 3x3 matrix.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    explodematrix(mlookat(vtorigin("","/obj/from"),vtorigin("","/obj/to")),"SRT","XYZ","RX")
    }}}
    
    Computes the lookat matrix and returns the rotation value for RX.
