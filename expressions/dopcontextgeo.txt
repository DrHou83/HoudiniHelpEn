= dopcontextgeo =

"""Returns the full path of the node connected to a dopnetwork."""

:usage: `dopcontextgeo(<<name>>, <<index>>)`

<<index>> is the 0-based number of the input. For example,
to get the path of the node connected to the first input,
use `dopcontextgeo(".", 0)`, and for the second input, use
`dopcontextgeo(".", 1)`.

This differs from `opinputpath` as the given name should be the name of a
node inside a dopnet (or the dopnet itself).  This simplifies the process of
finding what is wired up to a dopnet node at the SOP level. Passing "." as the
path will cause your containing dopnet to be used.
