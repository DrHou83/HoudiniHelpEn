"""Queries textual (string) data from an interactive render pane."""

:usage: `iprquerys(<<query>>, <<pane>>, <<x>>, <<y>>)`

Use [Exp:iprquery] to query numeric (floating point) information.

The <<query>> string argument specifies what type of information to
retrieve (see below). The <<pane>> argument specifies the name of the
pane you want to retrieve information for.

The <<x>> and <<y>> arguments are used by some query types to specify
additional query parameters. For queries that do not require extra
parameters, they are ignored.

The <<query>> string can be one of the following values:

object.instance:
    Full path of the instanced object that contributed the pixel at
    <<x>>, <<y>>. If the object was not instanced, this will be the same
    as `object.geometry`. See "Object queries" below. The <<x>> and
    <<y>> arguments are coordinates in the rendered image.
    
object.geometry:
    Full path of the geometry object that contributed the pixel at
    <<x>>, <<y>>. See "Object queries" below. The <<x>> and <<y>>
    arguments are coordinates in the rendered image.
    
object.surface:
    Full path of the surface shader that contributed the pixel at <<x>>,
    <<y>>. See "Object queries" below. The <<x>> and <<y>> arguments are
    coordinates in the rendered image.
    
object.displace:
    Full path of the displacement shader that affected the pixel at
    <<x>>, <<y>>. See "Object queries" below. The <<x>> and <<y>>
    arguments are coordinates in the rendered image.
    
plane.name:
    Returns the name of the plane at the index specified by the <<x>>
    argument to this function. For example, to get the name of the third
    deep raster plane:

    {{{
    #!exp
    iprquerys("plane.name", $PANE, 2, 0)
    }}}
    (The <<y>> argument, here set to 0, is ignored.)

rop:
    Returns the full path of the output driver node displayed in the
    interactive render pane.
    
== Object queries ==

The queries beginning with `object.` give you information about the
Houdini objects that produced the IPR image. These queries use two
deep raster planes mantra creates automatically when rendering.
These floating-point planes are named `Op_Id` and `Prim_Id`. Houdini
maintains a table mapping the data `Op_Id` plane to information
about the instance and geometry in the render. The numbers in the
`Op_Id` plane are meaningless otherwise.
