= dopoptions =

"""Returns the value of a DOP field as a string."""

:usage: `dopoptions(<<dop>>, <<objectSpec>>, <<subDataName>>,
    <<fieldName>>)`

This allows complex types such as vectors to be converted to the
native type using the [Exp:vector] expression.

This function is exactly the same as the dopfields function except the
fourth and fifth arguments are always "Options" and "0" respectively.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    vector(dopoptions("/obj/dopnet1", "obj0", "Position", "position"))
    }}}
    Gets the position of the object as a string and converts it into a
    vector.
