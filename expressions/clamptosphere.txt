= clamptosphere =

"""Clamps a vector to always end between a minimum and maximum sphere."""

:usage: `clamptosphere(<<x>>, <<y>>, <<z>>, <<min_radius>>, <<max_radius>>,
    <<constant_type>>)`

This function computes a vector R that is parallel to the given (x,y,z)
vector. R is adjusted so that its magnitude is always between the min
and max radii (i.e min_radius <= |R| <= max_radius)

This function returns one of the components of the vector R according
to the value of <<constant_type>>: "X", "Y" or "Z".
