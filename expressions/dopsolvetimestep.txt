:usage: `dopsolvetimestep()`

Returns the timestep size for the script solver that is
currently running.
    
This is one of a set of expression functions for use by the [Script
Solver DOP|Node:dop/scriptsolver]. Calling this function will return
zero if it is called when a script solver is not currently solving for
objects.
