= pulse =

"""Returns 1 when a value is within a certain range."""

:usage: `pulse(<<value>>, <<start>>, <<end>>)`

If the value is less than start or greater than end,
pulse returns a 0. Otherwise, it returns 1.

Frequently, start and end are frame numbers and val is based on
the current frame, `$F`. Using the modulus operator (`%`) you can
set up a pulse that turns on and off repeatedly as the frame
changes. For example, to blink on for 5 frames and then off for
five frames repeated (i.e. return 1 for frames 0 to 4, then 0 for
frames 5 to 9, then 1 for frames 10 to 14, etc.), use:

{{{
#!exp
pulse($F % 10, 0, 4)
}}}
