= cycleoffset =

"""Channel segment function: repeats the animation between frames <<f1>> and <<f2>>, accumulating the value."""

:usage: `cycleoffset(<<f1>>, <<f2>>)`

Each repeated portion will have its first value set
to the last value of the previous cycle. The rest of the values are set
such that their relative increments with respect to the first value
match the relative increments in the channel interval between <<f1>> and
<<f2>>. If you wish to repeat motion exactly, use the cycle function
instead.

If <<f1>> is less than <<f2>>, then it will cycle forwards from <<f1>>
to <<f2>>. If <<f2>> is less than <<f1>>, then it will cycle backwards
from <<f2>> to <<f1>>.
