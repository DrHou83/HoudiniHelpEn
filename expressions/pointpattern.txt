= pointpattern =

"""Returns a list of points that match a specified pattern."""

:usage: `pointpattern(<<surface_node>>, <<pattern>>)`

The pattern is a space separated list of point numbers, point number ranges,
or point group names.

The returned string is a space separated list of point numbers.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    pointpattern("/obj/model/sphere1", "2-5 10-12")
    }}}
    
    Returns "2 3 4 5 10 11 12", assuming the specified surface node exists and
    has that many points.

    {{{
    #!exp
    pointpattern("/obj/model/group1", "10 group1 20")
    }}}
    
    Returns a list of all points in the group named "group", as well as
    10 and 20. The order of the returned points is not guaranteed.
