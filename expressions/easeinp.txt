= easeinp =

"""Channel segment function: ease-in with configurable acceleration."""

:usage: `easeinp(<<number>>)`

Slowly increases the motion of the model to its maximum value.
This is similar to the motion
of an object accelerating due to gravity. The <<number>> controls how
fast to ease into the motion: a large value defines a high speed at the
end of the segment.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    easeinp( 10 )
    }}}
    
    Eases in with a fairly big final velocity.
