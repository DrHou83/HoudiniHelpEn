= dopnumrecords =

"""Returns the number of records of a given type in a piece of
dynamics data."""

:usage: `dopnumrecords(<<dop>>, <<objectFilter>>, <<subDataName>>,
    <<recordType>>)`

Note that this is different than the number of fields. The
Position/Options data type usually has one record that has several
fields, such as "position" and "orientation".

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    dopnumrecords("/obj/dopnet1", "object1", "Impacts", "Impacts")
    }}}
    
    Returns the number of records in the record type called "Impacts"
    found in the data called "Impacts", which is owned by the object
    "object1"
