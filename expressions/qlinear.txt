"""Channel segment function: uses quaternions to interpolate."""

:usage: `qlinear()`

A channel expression function which uses quaternions to interpolate
between the keyframed values. This function requires that it has two
neighboring channels named appropriately. This means they should end
with x, y, and z, or be three consecutive numbers starting from 0 (such
as 0, 1, 2, or 6, 7, 8).

Because the interpolation is done in quaternion space, the orientations
will blend smoothly with no gimbal lock or unexpected spins. However,
the rotation values may appear to jump suddenly. This is because
different rotation values can represent the same orientation.

Note in the graph editor a segment using this expression will show as a
dashed straight line. This does not represent the actual intermediate
channel values, but does give an accurate visual feel for the behavior
of the interpolation.
