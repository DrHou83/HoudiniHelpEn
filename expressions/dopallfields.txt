= dopallfields =

"""Returns a space separated list of all the field names that can be
passed to the dopfield function."""

:usage: `dopallfields(<<dop>>, <<objectSpec>>, <<subDataName>>,
    <<recordType>>)`

This list is not the same as the values
returned from the [Exp:dopfieldname] function because it includes all the
subvalues that can be accessed. For example if there is a vector field
named "t", the dopfieldname function would simply return "t". This
function would return "tx ty tz" (along with all the other field names).
Note that "t" is not even in this list because dopfield returns a single
float value and so cannot access a vector like "t" directly.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    dopallfields("/obj/dopnet1", "obj0", "Position", "Options")
    }}}
    Returns all the field name values that can be passed to the dopfield
    function. This list would begin "angvelx angvely angvelz ...".
