:usage: `instancepoint()`
    
This function takes no arguments. You can use this function in
parameter expressions on objects being instanced
(see [point instancing|/copy/instancing]). It returns the point
number the object is being instanced onto. You can use this to
vary _object-level_ parameters (such as transforms or material
overrides) between instances.

You can *not* use this function at the surface level, because
instancing only works at the object level.
