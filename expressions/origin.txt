:usage: `origin(<<obj1>>, <<obj2>>, <<constant_type>>)`

This function will return one of TX, TY, TZ, RX, RY, RZ, SX, SY, SZ
value necessary to transform obj1 to obj2, depending on the type
argument ("TX", "TY", "TZ", "RX", "RY", "RZ", "SX", "SY" or "SZ" ).

This can also be thought of as the position of obj2 relative to obj1.
It will compute the position of obj1 relative to obj2 and returns one of
TX, TY, TZ, RX, RY, RZ, SX, SY, SZ based on the type argument.

If the empty string ("") is specified for either obj1 or obj2, then the
identity transform will be used instead.  For example, if obj1 is the
empty string, then the world space position of obj2 is returned.
