= xyzdist =

"""Returns the distance between a 3D coordinate and a primitive."""

:usage: `xyzdist(<<x>>, <<y>>, <<z>>, <<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>,
    <<return_type>>)`

If the <<prim_num>> is -1, finds the closest distance to any
primitive in the surface node.

* return_type = 0 returns the minimum distance.

* return_type = 1 returns the u parametric value at the point of minimum
  distance.

* return_type = 2 returns the v parametric value at the point of minimum
  distance.

* return_type = 3 returns the primitive number that was closest.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    xyzdist(1, 2, 3, "/obj/geo1/grid1", 0, 0)
    }}}
    
    Returns the distance between (1, 2, 3) and the closest spot from the
    surface of grid1 primitive number 0. If the return_type were 1, the
    u parametric value that is closest to the point would be returned.
