= easeoutp =

"""Channel segment function: ease-out with configurable acceleration."""

:usage: `easeoutp(<<number>>)`

Similar to the [Exp:easeinp]
expression only reversed. The change starts rapidly and begins to slow
until it comes to rest. The <<number>> determines the speed (i.e., the
rate of channel change) at the beginning of the segment. A large value
defines a high speed.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    easeoutp( 3 )
    }}}
    
    Eases out of a fairly high initial speed.
