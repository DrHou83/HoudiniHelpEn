"""Returns the minimum distance and closest points between two primitives."""

:usage: `primdist(<<surface_node>>, <<prim1_num>>, <<surface_node>>, <<prim2_num>>,
    <<return_type>>)`

- <<return_type>> = 0: minimum distance
- <<return_type>> = 1: U value of closest point on primitive 1
- <<return_type>> = 2: V value of closest point on primitive 1
- <<return_type>> = 3: U value of closest point on primitive 2
- <<return_type>> = 4: V value of closest point on primitive 2
    
Only works for faces, curves, and spline surfaces. Other types of
primitives will always return 0.

NOTE:
    Minimum works in two groups. You can either use minimum between curves and polygons or between meshes, nurbs surfaces, and bezier surfaces. However, it will not work between the two groups. For example, a NURBS curve + NURBS surface will not work. 

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    primdist("/obj/geo1/sphere1", 0, "/obj/geo1/grid1", 0, 0)
    }}}
    
    Returns the distance between the first primitives in both sphere1
    and grid1.
