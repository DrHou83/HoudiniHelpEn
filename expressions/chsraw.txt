"""Returns the raw (unexpanded) expression value of a parameter as a string."""

:usage: `chsraw(<<channel>>)`

Variables will NOT be expanded. If the given path
is a channel, then it returns the expression of the channel that is
evaluated at the current time.

If you do:

{{{
#!exp
echo `chsraw("channel_path")`
}}}

...this will appear to lose your formatting because hscript expands
double quotes before passing the result of the backtick expression
to the echo command. Multiple levels of escaping is necessary in
order to maintain them.
