"""Returns the fractional part of a floating-point number."""

:usage: `frac(<<number>>)`

The fractional
component is computed using the expression `(number - floor(number))`,
which may result in unexpected values for negative numbers. If negative
numbers are an issue, you may want to call `frac(abs(number))`.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    frac(2.501) = 0.501
    }}}
