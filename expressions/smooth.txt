= smooth =

"""Takes a value and range and returns a smooth interpolation
between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `smooth(<<value>>, <<minimum>>, <<maximum>>)`

When <<value>> is less than <<minimum>>, the return value is 0.
If <<value>> is greater than <<maximum>>, the return value is 1.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    smooth ($F, 12, 55)
    }}}
    
    This example will generate an ease-type curve between values 0 and 1,
    starting at frame 12 and ending at frame 55. Dig it!
