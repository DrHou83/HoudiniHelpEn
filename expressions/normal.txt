= normal =

"""Returns the components of the surface normal specific UV coordinates."""

:usage: `normal(<<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>, <<u>>, <<v>>, <<index>>)`

<<u>> and <<v>> are unit values, defined in the `[0,1]` interval.
If the primitive is a mesh, u and v are defined in terms its number
of rows and columns.

<<index>> specifies which component to return, where `0` means X, `1` means Y,
and `2` means Z.
