= poppointid =

"""Returns the value of a particle attribute, by particle ID."""

:usage: `poppointid(<<particle_id>>, <<attribute>>, <<index>>)`

TIP:
    It is more efficient to use the [Exp:poppoint] function
    (which looks up the particle by number instead of ID)
    whenever possible.
    
You should only use this function in a particle node.
