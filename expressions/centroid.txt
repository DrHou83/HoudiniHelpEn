= centroid =

"""Returns centroid information for a surface node."""

:usage: `centroid(<<surface_node>>, <<type>>)`

The <<type>> should
be one of `D_X`, `D_Y`, or `D_Z` for the corresponding components of the
centroid.

{{{
centroid("../sphere1", D_X)
centroid("../sphere1", D_Y)
centroid("../sphere1", D_Z)
}}}

NOTE:
    The centroid is the center of the bounding box of the points, not the average position of the points.
