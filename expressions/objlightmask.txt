= objlightmask =

"""Returns a list of lights matching an object's light mask."""

:usage: `objlightmask(<<geometry>>, <<options>>)`

This is a slightly more general form of the [Exp:oplightmask] function.
    
Returns a string containing a space separated list of path names.

The options allow some control over how the light names are generated.
Currently, options include:

`f`:
    Generate full path names for the lights. If this option is excluded,
    the path names will be generated relative to /obj
    
`a`:
    Ignore ambient lights.
    
`A`:
    Only include ambient lights.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    objlightmask("/obj/geo1", "fa")
    }}}
    
    Returns all the lights in /obj/geo1's light-mask. Any ambient lights
    will be excluded from the expanded string, and the paths generated
    will be the full path name of the light. The string might look
    something like "/obj/light1 /obj/light2 /obj/subnet1/light1".
