"""Generates spatially coherent 3D noise."""

:usage: `turb(<<X>>, <<Y>>, <<Z>>, <<depth>>)`

Spatially coherent noise gives random numbers which are close
to each other when the X, Y, Z inputs are close to each other.

<<depth>> is the amount of fractalization done to the noise.

The noise is calculated on a unit-spaced lattice.  This means the
noise will be independent between points one unit distance apart.  You
can scale the inputs to achieve different frequencies.

The range is usually within -1 to 1, but can exceed it depending on
the depth.  The maximum range is -2 to 2 for high depths.
