= degree =

"""Returns the degree a specified face or hull."""

:usage: `degree(<<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>, D_U|D_V)`

Polygons and meshes are expressed as
linear functions, so their degree is 1. Spline types -- NURBS and Bezier
curves and surfaces -- have degrees ranging from 1 to 10.

NOTE:
    If the primitive is a polygon or a curve, D_U and D_V are
    irrelevant.
