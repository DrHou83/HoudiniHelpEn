"""Computes the active stream of a node."""

In POPs there is the idea of an active stream.  This is the set of particles a micro solver should work on by virtue of its inputs.  The `opstreamname` expression computes the ad hoc point group for the nodes active stream.

If the node has only a single solid input that leads to a generator, this will evaluate to the `streamname` parameter of that generator. But, in the presence of merge nodes, it may produce a list of groups that form the active stream.

:usage: `string opstreamname(<<nodepath>>)`
