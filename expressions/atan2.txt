= atan2 =

"""Returns the arc-tangent of <<y>>/<<x>>."""

:usage: `atan2(<<y>>, <<x>>)`

This is more stable than [Exp:atan] since it
can use the signs of y and x to determine the quadrant the angle is in.
It also handles the case where x is zero correctly, returning 90 or -90.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    atan2(1, 0) = 90
    }}}
    {{{
    #!exp
    atan2(0, 1) = 0
    }}}
    {{{
    #!exp
    atan2(0, -1) = 180
    }}}
