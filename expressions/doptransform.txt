= doptransform =

"""Returns a transformation matrix associated with a piece of data."""

:usage: `doptransform(<<dop>>, <<objectSpec>>, <<subDataName>>)`

The data must be either Position data or Geometry data.
For Geometry data, if the data name is "Geometry", then the transform
for any Position data attached to the object is also applied. Thus this
function can be used to transform a point position from the space of the
raw geometry to simulation space.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    doptransform("/obj/dopnet1", "obj0", "Geometry")
    }}}
    
    Returns a matrix which is the product of the transform in the
    Geometry data multiplied by the transform of any Position data on
    the object.
