= vtorigin =

"""Returns a vector of an object's translations."""

:usage: `vtorigin(<<obj1>>, <<obj2>>)`

This function will return a vector containing the translates required
to transform obj1 to the space of obj2.

This can also be thought of as the position of obj2 relative to obj1.

If the empty string ("") is specified for either obj1 or obj2, then the
identity transform will be used instead.  For example, if obj1 is the
empty string, then the world space position of obj2 is returned.
