= seampoints =

"""Lists all seam points in a surface node."""

:usage: `seampoints(<<surface_node>>, <<whichside>>)`

This function returns a string containing an ordered list of all seam
points in the specified surface node. Seam points are identified by seam attributes on the points.

The <<whichside>> argument specifies which side of the seams we are
interested in. The value can be either zero or one.

Calling this function once with
a whichside parameter of zero, and once with a whichside parameter of
one, will provide two lists of points where tying each point to the
corresponding point in the other list fully describes all seams on the
geometry.
