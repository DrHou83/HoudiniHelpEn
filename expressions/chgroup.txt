= chgroup =

"""return a string containing all of the channels contained in
a group."""

:usage: `chgroup(<<group_name>>)`

@examples
    This is useful in the command language for traversing
    all channels in a group:

    {{{
    #!exp
    % foreach channel ( `chgroup("group_name")` ) % echo $channel is in group_name % end 
    }}}
