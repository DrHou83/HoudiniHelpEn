"""Script solver support function."""

:usage: `dopsolveobject(<<object_index>>)`

This function returns the unique object identifier for the specified
object. The object is specified as a number greater than or equal to
zero, and less than the return value of
[Exp:dopsolvenumobjects]. This function is required
to get an object id to use in other DOP expression function for getting
data about the objects being solved by the script solver.
    
This is one of a set of expression functions for use by the [Script
Solver DOP|Node:dop/scriptsolver]. Calling this function will return -1
if it is called when a script solver is not currently solving for
objects.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    set lastobject=`dopsolvenumobjects() - 1`
    for i = 0 to $lastobject
        echo `dopsolveobject($i)`
    end
    
    }}}
    
    Outputs the unique object ids of all the objects being solved by the
    current script solver.
