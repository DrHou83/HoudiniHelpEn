= argc =

"""Returns the number of arguments in an HScript-style list of arguments."""

:usage: `argc(<<line>>)`

Standard parsing is done, no variable expansion
is done on the line.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    argc("This has four arguments")
    }}}
    Returns 4, as that is the number of space delimited words.

    {{{
    #!exp
    argc("Quoting 'makes this one arg'")
    }}}
    Returns two as the quotes cause the last four words to count as a
    single word.
