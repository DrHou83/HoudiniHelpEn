"""Returns the value of a DOP field as a float."""

:usage: `dopoption(<<dop>>, <<objectSpec>>, <<subDataName>>,
    <<fieldName>>)`

If a field is multivalued, you can access individual parameters by
adding a suffix.

For example, "positiony" will access the y component of the "position"
field. If the field is a quaternion, one can use "rx", "ry", and "rz" as
extensions to get the euler rotations for the quaternion.

This function is exactly the same as the [Exp:dopfield] function except the
fourth and fifth arguments are always "Options" and "0" respectively.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    dopoption("/obj/dopnet1", "obj0", "Position", "ty")
    }}}
    
    Returns the y position of object obj0

    {{{
    #!exp
    dopoption("/obj/dopnet1", "obj0", "Position", "ry")
    }}}
    
    Returns the ry component of the orientation of object obj0. This
    will be in degrees.
