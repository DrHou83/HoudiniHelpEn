= vector =

"""Converts a string specification into a vector."""

:usage: `vector(<<pattern>>)`

The pattern should
consist of a leading square bracket followed by a comma-separated list
of values and a closing square bracket.

To access a value out of the vector, use the square bracket operator.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    vector v = vector("[1,2,3,4,5]");
    float  f = v[0]; # f is 1
    }}}
