= pointneighbours =

"""Lists points that share a minimum number of primitives with
a specified point."""

:usage: `pointneighbours(<<surface_node>>, <<point_num>>, <<num_shared_prims>>)`

This function lists all the points that share at
least <<num_shared_prims>> primitives with the point specified by
<<point_num>>.

The returned string is a space separated list of point numbers.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    pointneighbours("/obj/geo1/sphere1", 88, 2)
    }}}
    
    Returns a list of numbers that identify the points in sphere1 that
    share at least 2 primitives (typically along an edge) with sphere1
    point number 88.

    {{{
    #!exp
    pointneighbours("/obj/geo1/sphere1", 88, 1)
    }}}
    Returns a list of numbers that identify the points in sphere1 that
    share at least 1 primitive with sphere1 point number 88.

    {{{
    #!exp
    pointneighbours("/obj/geo1/sphere1", 88, 0)
    }}}
    Returns a list of all the points in sphere1 except point number 88.
