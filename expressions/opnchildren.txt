= opnchildren =

"""Returns the number of nodes inside a container node."""

:usage: `opnchildren(<<name>>)`

This will return the number of nodes in a subnetwork or the number of surface
nodes in an Geometry container object.

The count is non-recursive: it only counts the direct contents of the node,
not of the sub-nodes as well.
