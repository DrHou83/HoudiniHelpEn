= primneighbours =

"""Lists primitives that share a minimum number of points with a
specified primitive."""

:usage: `primneighbours(<<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>, <<num_shared_pts>>)`

This function lists all the primitives that share
at least the given number of points with the primitive specified. 

The returned string is a space separated list of primitive numbers.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    primneighbours("/obj/geo1/sphere1", 88, 2)
    }}}
    
    Returns a list of numbers that identify the primitives in sphere1
    that share at least 2 points (typically along an edge) with sphere1
    primitive number 88.

    {{{
    #!exp
    primneighbours("/obj/geo1/sphere1", 88, 1)
    }}}
    
    Returns a list of numbers that identify the primitives in sphere1
    that share at least 1 point with sphere1 primitive number 88.

    {{{
    #!exp
    primneighbours("/obj/geo1/sphere1", 88, 0)
    }}}
    
    Returns a list of all the primitives in sphere1 except primitive
    number 88.
