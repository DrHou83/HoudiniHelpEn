"""Converts unit UV to real UV."""

:usage: `realuv(<<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>, <<uv_unit>>, <<D_U|D_V>>)`

The unit value is defined in the `[0,1]` interval. The
real value is defined in the valid interval of the primitive's domain if
the primitive is a spline type. If the primitive is a polygon or a mesh,
the size of its domain is given by the number of vertices, or rows or
columns respectively. If the primitive is a polygon or a curve, D_U and
D_V are irrelevant.

NOTE:
    the result is undefined if the primitive is neither a face nor a
    hull.
