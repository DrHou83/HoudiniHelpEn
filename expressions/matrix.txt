= matrix =

"""Converts a string specification into a matrix."""

:usage: `matrix(<<pattern>>)`

The string should start with a square bracket,
followed by a series of rows (specified as vector
patterns - see the [Exp:vector] function), followed by a trailing square
bracket.

To access a row out of the matrix, use the square bracket operator.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    matrix m = matrix("[[1,2,3][2,3,5][-3,2,-3]]");
    vector v = m[0];    # v is [1,2,3]
    float  f = m[0][2]; # f is 3
    }}}
