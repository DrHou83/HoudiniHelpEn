"""Channel segment function: ease-in and -out with configurable acceleration."""

:usage: `easep(<<number>>)`

This is a channel expression function which will gradually ease in to
the motion and gradually ease out. The <<number>> controls how fast to
ease in or out. Mathematically, this argument determines the inflection
point of the curve. Increasing the number will shift the inflection
point to the right, while fractional numbers will towards zero will
shift the inflection point to the right.



@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    easep( 3 )
    }}}
    Eases in slowly and eases out quickly.

    {{{
    #!exp
    easep( 0.4 )
    }}}
    Eases in quickly and eases out slowly.
