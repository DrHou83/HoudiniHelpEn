= originoffset =

"""Returns components of an object's offset transforms."""

:usage: `originoffset(<<obj1>>, <<pos1>>, <<obj2>>, <<pos2>>,
    <<constant_type>>)`

This function will return one of TX, TY, TZ, RX, RY, RZ value necessary
to transform the point pos1 in the space of object obj1 to point pos2 in
the space of object obj2, depending on the type argument ("TX", "TY",
"TZ", "RX", "RY" or "RZ").

This can also be thought of as the position of pos2 in obj2 relative to
pos1 in obj1.

If the empty string ("") is specified for either obj1 or obj2, then the
identity transform will be used instead.  For example, if obj1 is the
empty string, then the world space position of obj2 is returned.
