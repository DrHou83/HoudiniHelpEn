= determinant =

"""Returns the determinant of a matrix."""

:usage: `determinant(<<mat>>)`

This is only valid for a 4x4 or 3x3 matrix.
If the matrix is larger than 4x4, the
4x4 determinant will be returned. If the matrix is smaller than 3x3, the
matrix will be converted to a 3x3 before the determinant is computed.
The results of the upward conversion are not guaranteed.
