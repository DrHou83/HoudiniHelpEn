"""Returns the velocity that a point at a location in simulation space
would have if it were attached to a DOP object."""

:usage: `dopvelatpos(<<dop>>, <<objectSpec>>, <<posx>>, <<posy>>, <<posz>>,
    <<usevolumevelocity>>, <<usepointvelocity>>)`

This velocity calculation takes into account the velocity and angular
velocity of the simulation object as stored in its Position data.

Setting the usevolumevelocity argument to a non-zero value causes the
returned velocity to be affected by a geometry space velocity calculated
from changes in the volumetric representation of the geometry.

Setting the usepointvelocity argument to a non-zero value causes the
returned velocity to be affected by the velocity attribute on the
geometry for the object. The geometry velocity attribute is added to the
result as a geometry space velocity which is added to the velocity from
the Position data. If both usedsdfvelocity and usepointvelocity are
non-zero, then the sdf velocity is used, not the point velocity.

    Returns the simulation space velocity of point 0 of the geometry
    attached to obj0, taking into account any velocity attribute on the
    geometry.
