"""Returns the value of a vertex attribute."""

:usage: `vertex(<<surface_node>>, <<primitive_number>>, <<vertex_number>>,
    <<attribute>>, <<index>>)`

<<attribute>> is the name of the attribute (eg. "Cd"
for diffuse color). Two special attributes exist "P" and "Pw" which
represent the position of the point in space ("Pw" allows you to access
the W component of the position).

NOTE:
    This function will interpolate between point values if the vertex
    number is fractional, such as 3.35.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    vertex("/obj/geo1/facet1", 2, 3, "P", 0)
    }}}
    
    Return the X component of vertex 3 of primitive2 in the facet1
    surface node of geo1.

    {{{
    #!exp
    point("/obj/geo1/facet1", 2, 3, "Cd", 2)
    }}}
    
    Returns the Z component of the color attribute of vertex 3 of
    primitive 2 in the facet1 surface node of object geo1.
