= oldrand =

"""Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1."""

:usage: `oldrand(<<value>>)`

Using the same <<value>> will give the same result each time. A
different number is returned if fractional values are different.

NOTE:
    It is a good idea to use non-integer values as the argument to
    oldrand(). This function is similar to rand() but uses a different
    algorithm for generating the random numbers.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    oldrand(12.1) gives a different result than oldrand(12.2)
    }}}
