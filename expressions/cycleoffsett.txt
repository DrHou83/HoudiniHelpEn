= cycleoffsett =

"""Channel segment function: repeats the animation between times <<t1>> and <<t2>>, accumulating the value."""

:usage: `cycleoffsett(<<t1>>, <<t2>>)`

Each repeated portion will have its first value set
to the last value of the previous cycle. If you wish to repeat motion
exactly, use the cyclet function instead.

If <<t1>> is less than <<t2>>, then it will cycle forwards from <<t1>>
to <<t2>>. If <<t2>> is less than <<t1>>, then it will cycle backwards
from <<t2>> to <<t1>>.
