= clamp =

"""Returns a value clamped between a minimum and maximum."""

:usage: `clamp(<<value>>, <<minimum>>, <<maximum>>)`

This is useful to prevent the value from
going outside the specified range.

If the value is less than the minimum number, the minimum number
will be returned. If the value is greater than the maximum number, the
maximum number will be returned.
