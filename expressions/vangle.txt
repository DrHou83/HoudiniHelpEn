"""Returns the angle between two vectors."""

:usage: `vangle(<<v0>>, <<v1>>)`

`vangle(a, b)` will return the same result as `acos ( dot (normalize(a), normalize(b)) )`. It will not produce a negative result because the dot product is symmetric, and does not take the order of a and b into consideration.

You can define a turning order with the left hand rule or something similar. 

TIP:
    Try the following expression to get a signed result: `sign(dot(cross(cross(a,b),b),a)) * vangle(a,b)`
