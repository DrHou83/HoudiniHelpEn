"""Returns the length of the 3D curve between two points on a surface."""

:usage: `surflen(<<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>, <<ustart>>, <<vstart>>, <<ustop>>,
    <<vstop>>)`
    
Given a surface and two parametric points in its domain (
`[ustart,vstart]` and `[ustop,vstop]` ), surflen computes the length of the
3D curve that stretches between the two points. This curve is the 3D
image of the line in the surface domain, whose end-points are
`[ustart,vstart]` and `[ustop,vstop]`. If either u or v is kept constant,
the 3D curve coincides with an isoparm.

All four uv numbers are unit values, defined in the `[0,1]` interval.

NOTE:
    the primitive must be either a NURBS surface or a Bezier surface. A
    polygonal mesh can be simulated by a bi-linear Bezier surface (u and
    v order 2).

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    surflen("/obj/geo1/grid1", 12, 0, 1, 0.2, 0.8)
    }}}
    
    Computes the length of the curve on surface #12, defined
    parametrically by the surface domain points `[0,1]` and `[0.2, 0.8]`.
