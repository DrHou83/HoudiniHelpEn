"""Generates spatially coherent 3D noise based on sparse convolution."""

:usage: `sturb(<<X>>, <<Y>>, <<Z>>, <<depth>>)`

Spatially coherent noise gives random numbers which are close
to each other when the X, Y, Z inputs are close to each other.
    
<<depth>> is the amount of fractalization of the noise.

This is very similar to [Exp:turb], except instead of finding noise values
on a fixed lattice and interpolating, this function finds noise
values on points scattered in space and interpolated according
to the Voronoi decomposition.
