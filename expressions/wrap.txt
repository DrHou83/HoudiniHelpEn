= wrap =

"""Wraps a value between a minimum and maximum."""

:usage: `wrap(<<value>>, <<minimum>>, <<maximum>>)`

Similar to the clamp expression in that the resulting value will always
fall between the specified minimum and maximum value. It will, however,
create a sawtooth wave for continuously increasing or decreasing values
of the value.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    wrap ($F, 5, 10)
    }}}
    
    Creates a sawtooth function between 5 and 10.
