= popcontextgeo =

"""Returns the full path to a particle network context geometry."""

:usage: `popcontextgeo(<<index>>)`

An <<index>> of 0 corresponds to the first context geometry.
This function should only be used from within a particle node.

The [POP Network surface node|Node:sop/popnet] has four inputs
to which you can connect geometry. You can then access the connected
geometry using this function. This is simply a convenience to let
you associate geometry with a particle network without hard-coding
node paths.

NOTE:
    Pop Merge SOPs might also cook the particular POP network. In that case,
    this function will give the path of the inputs of the corresponding Pop
    Merge SOP.
