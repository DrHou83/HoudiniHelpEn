"""Evaluates the parameter at the current time as a node path list string."""

:usage: `chsoplist("path")`

Assumes the given parameter contains a list of node paths, and automatically takes care of things like bundles and relative paths, returning a string containing an absolute path or a space-separated list of absolute paths. It can also expand adhoc bundle strings like `/obj/null*`.

For example, to get the __Object__ node path used by the `object_merge1` node:

{{{
#!hscript
chsoplist("../object_merge1/object1")
}}}
