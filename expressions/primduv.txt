"""Returns the partial derivatives of a primitive attribute."""

:usage: `primduv(<<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>, <<attrib_name>>, <<attrib_index>>,
    <<u>>, <<v>>, <<du>>, <<dv>>)`

Evaluates the (partial) derivatives of a face or hull attribute at a
parametric (u,v) position. u and v are unit values, defined in the
`[0,1]` interval. When given the "P" or "Pw" attribute, the positional
derivative of (u,v)'s image on the primitive will be returned. If the
primitive is a face type, v and dv are ignored. If both du and dv are 0,
primduv becomes equivalent to primuv.

NOTE:
    if the primitive is a polygon or a mesh, u and v are defined in
    terms of the number of vertices, or rows or columns respectively.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    primduv("/obj/geo1/tube1", 12, "P", 2, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 0)
    }}}
    
    Evaluates the Z component of the first-order partial derivative of
    primitive 12 with respect to u, at the parametric location
    (0.4,0.5).
