"""Generates 3D noise."""

:usage: `noise(<<X>>, <<Y>>, <<Z>>)`

The noise is calculated on a unit-spaced lattice and then internal
points are interpolated from lattice points.  This means the
noise will be independent between points one unit distance apart.  You
can scale the inputs to achieve different frequencies.
    
This function can be used to apply noise to geometry. For example to
make a bumpy grid you could append a point surface node and use the following
in the pos Z field:

`noise($TX, $TY, $TZ)`
