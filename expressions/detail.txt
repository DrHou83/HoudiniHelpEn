= detail =

"""Returns the value of a detail attribute."""

:usage: `detail(<<surface_node>>, <<attrib_name>>, <<attrib_index>>)`

TIP:
    This expression may not work if <<surface_node>> is the _currently cooking_ node.
    Try specifying an upstream node.

This can also be used to read the value of a detail intrinsic by specifying
`"intrinsic:name_of_intrinsic"` instead of an attribute name.

@examples

{{{
#!exp
detail("/obj/geo1/attribpromote1", "area", 0)
}}}

Returns the total area of the geometry, if the geometry had first
been measured and then AttribPromote had promoted the area primitive
attribute to a detail attribute with Sum as the promotion method.
