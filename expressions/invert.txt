"""Inverts a matrix."""

:usage: `invert(<<mat>>)`

This is only valid if the matrix is a 4x4 or
3x3 matrix. If the matrix is larger than 4x4, the matrix will be
converted to a 4x4 matrix before it is inverted. If the matrix is
smaller than 3x3, the matrix will be enlarged to a 3x3 matrix before it
is inverted. The results of enlarging the matrix to a 3x3 are not
guaranteed.
