= explodematrixp =

"""Explodes a 3x3 or 4x4 matrix into the euler rotations required to
rebuild it."""

:usage: `explodematrixp(<<mat>>, <<p>>, <<trs>>, <<xyz>>, <<component>>)`

The returned components can be stuffed directly into Houdini
rotation, scale, and translate channels.

This expression is exactly like
[Exp:explodematrix], except it requires you to specify a pivot position
vector. This is useful if you know the pivot position of the matrix
being processed.  Use [Exp:explodematrixpr] if you know the pivot rotation
of the matrix being processed.

<<mat>> is the matrix to transform. <<trs>> and <<xyz>> give the order of the
expansion. In trs, a "t" represents translation, "r" rotation, and "s"
scale. The xyz refers to the order of the rotations. The component is a
string describing which channel to extract. It is `[trs][xyz]`
(e.g. `"tx"` or `"ry"`), where the `t`, `r`, or `s` chooses the channel
(translate, rotate, or scale), and the `x`, `y`, or `z` chooses the axis.
Shears can be extracted by specifying a component of "sh1", "sh2", or "sh3".
