= spknot =

"""Returns a knot value on a spline curve or surface."""

:usage: `spknot(<<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>, <<knot_index>>, D_U|D_V)`

This spline-specific function returns the floating-point knot value,
given the knot index in the U or V knot sequence. The first valid knot
index is 0. If the primitive is a Bezier curve or surface, the values
returned are those of its breakpoints.

If the primitive is a curve, the fourth argument (`D_U` or `D_V`)
is irrelevant.
