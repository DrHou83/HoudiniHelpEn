"""Queries numeric (floating point) data from an interactive render pane."""

:usage: `iprquery(<<query>>, <<pane>>, <<x>>, <<y>>)`

Use [Exp:iprquerys] to query textual (string) information.

The <<query>> string argument specifies what type of information to
retrieve (see below). The <<pane>> argument specifies the name of the
pane you want to retrieve information for.

The <<x>> and <<y>> arguments are used by some query types to specify
additional query parameters. For queries that do not require extra
parameters, they are ignored.

The <<query>> string can be one of the following values:

`cropx0`, `cropx1`, `cropy0`, `cropy1`:
    Returns the left, right, top, or bottom values of the currently
    selected crop region.
    
`exist.<<plane_name>>`:
    Returns the index of the given plane if it exists in the rendered
    image, or -1 if it does not.
    
`ipr`:
    Returns 1 if the IPR button is on, or 0 if it is off.
    
`lock`:
    Returns 1 if the lock button is on (prevents automatic
    re-rendering), or 0 if it is off.
    
`nplanes`:
    Returns the number of deep raster planes in the current image.
    
`object.ptinstance`:
    Point number of the instance object (see "Object queries" below)
    that contributed the pixel at <<x>>,<<y>>. The <<x>> and <<y>>
    variables are coordinates in the rendered image.
    
`object.primitive`:
    Primitive number of the geometry object (see "Object queries" below)
    that contributed the pixel at <<x>>,<<y>>. The <<x>> and <<y>>
    variables are coordinates in the rendered image.
    
`pindex.<<name>>`:
    Returns the index of the deep raster plane named <<name>>. If there
    is no plane by that name, returns -1.
    
`plane.vsize`:
    Returns the vector size of the plane at the index specified by the
    <<x>> argument to this function. For example, to get the vector size
    of the third deep raster plane:

    {{{
    #!exp
    iprquery("plane.vsize", $PANE, 2, 0)
    }}}
    (The <<y>> argument, here set to 0, is ignored.)

`plane.<<name>>[.r|g|b|a]`:
    Returns the value of the pixel component at <<x>>,<<y>> of the plane
    named <<name>>. For example:

    {{{
    #!exp
    iprquery("plane.C.g", $PANE, $IX, $IY)
    }}}
    If you don't specify a component name (`.r`, `.g`, `.b`, or `.a`),
    returns the value of the first component.

    You can also use `.x`, `.y`, `.z`, and `.w` as alternate names for
    `.r`, `.g`, `.b`, and `.a`. For example, `plane.N.y` is equivalent
    to `plane.N.g`.

`xres`, `yres`:
    horizontal or vertical resolution of the image in the interactive
    render viewer.
    
== Object queries ==

The queries beginning with `object.` give you information about the
Houdini objects that produced the IPR image. These queries use two
deep raster planes mantra creates automatically when rendering.
These floating-point planes are named `Op-Id` and `Prim-Id`. Houdini
maintains a table mapping the data `Op-Id` plane to information
about the instance and geometry in the render. _The numbers in the
Op-Id plane are meaningless otherwise_.
