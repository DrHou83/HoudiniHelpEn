= pointavg =

"""Returns the average of an attribute across all points in a geometry."""

:usage: `pointavg(<<surface_node>>, <<attribute>>, <<index>>)`

This function works much like the [Exp:point] function, except that it
returns the average value of the attribute for all points in the
specified surface node.
