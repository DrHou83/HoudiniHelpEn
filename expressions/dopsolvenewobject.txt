"""Script solver support function."""

:usage: `dopsolvenewobject(<<object_index>>)`

This function is similar to dopsolveobject, except it returns the newly created
objects that need to be initialized from a script solver.  The object index
must be greater than or equal to zero, and less than the return value of
[Exp:dopsolvenumnewobjects].

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    set lastobject=`dopsolvenumnewobjects() - 1`
    for i = 0 to $lastobject
        echo `dopsolvenewobject($i)`
    end
    
    }}}
    
    Outputs the unique object ids of all the objects being initialized by the
    current script solver.
