"""Returns the distance between a point and a primitive."""

:usage: `pointdist(<<surface_node>>, <<point_num>>, <<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>,
    <<return_type>>)`

Given a point and a primitive, this function finds the distance between
the point and the closest spot on the primitive. If prim_num is minus
one, the closest distance to any primitive is found.

* return_type = 0 returns the minimum distance.

* return_type = 1 returns the u parametric value at the point of minimum
  distance.

* return_type = 2 returns the v parametric value at the point of minimum
  distance.

* return_type = 3 returns the primitive number that was closest. Enter
  -1 as the <<prim_num>>.

@examples

{{{
#!exp
pointdist("/obj/geo1/add1", 0, "/obj/geo1/grid1", 0, 0)
}}}

Returns the distance between point 0 of add1 and the closest spot
from the surface of grid1 primitive number 0. If the return_type
were 1, the u parametric value that is closest to the point would be
returned.
