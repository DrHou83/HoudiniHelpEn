= curvature =

"""Returns the curvature of the surface at the given UV coordinates."""

:usage: `curvature(<<surface_node>>, <<prim_num>>, <<u>>, <<v>>)`

<<u>> and <<v>> are unit values, defined in the `[0, 1]` interval.

NOTE:
    if the primitive is a mesh, u and v are defined in terms of its
    number of rows and columns.
