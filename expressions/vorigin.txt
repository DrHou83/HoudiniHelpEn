= vorigin =

"""Returns a vector of an objects' transforms."""

:usage: `vorigin(<<obj1>>, <<obj2>>)`

This function will return a vector with 6 values in it. The values are
set to `[TX, TY, TZ, RX, RY, RZ]` for the position of obj1 relative to
obj2.

This can also be thought of as the position of obj2 relative to obj1.

If the empty string ("") is specified for either obj1 or obj2, then the
identity transform will be used instead.  For example, if obj1 is the
empty string, then the world space position of obj2 is returned.
