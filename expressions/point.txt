"""Returns the value of a point attribute."""

:usage:`point(<<surface_node>>, <<point_number>>, <<attribute>>, <<index>>)`

    <<surface_node>> is a path to a surface node, for example `"/obj/geo1/grid1"`.
    
    <<point_number>> is the point number to read the attribute from.
    When instancing, you can use [Exp:instancepoint] to get the number of the
    point currently being instanced.

    <<attribute>> is the name of the attribute (for example, `Cd` for diffuse
    color). Two special attributes exist: `P` and `Pw` which represent the
    position of the point in space (`Pw` allows you to access the W
    component of the position).

    [Include:_index_argument]

NOTE:
    This function will interpolate between point values if the point
    number is fractional, such as 3.35


@examples

{{{
#!exp
point("/obj/geo1/facet1", 3, "P", 0)
}}}

Returns the X component of point 3 of the facet1 surface node in geo1.

{{{
#!exp
point("/obj/geo1/facet1", 3, "N", 2)
}}}

Returns the Z component of the normal attribute of point 3 in the
    facet1 surface node of object geo1.
