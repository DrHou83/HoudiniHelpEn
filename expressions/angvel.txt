= angvel =

"""Returns the angular velocity required to
rotate an object from one orientation to another in a certain period of
time."""

:usage: `angvel(<<rot1>>, <<rot2>>, <<time>>)`

The original rotation is specified in rot1, and the destination
rotation in rot2. These values can be either a vector3 containing euler
rotation angles in degrees, or a vector4 containing a quaternion. The
returned angular velocity value is expressed in degrees per second, and
represents the shortest path between the two orientations.

    #!exp
    angvel(vector3(0, 0, 0), vector3(90, 0, 0), 1)[0]=90
    }}}
