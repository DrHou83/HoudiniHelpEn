= vector3 =

"""Converts three values into a 3-component vector."""

:usage: `vector3(<<x>>, <<y>>, <<z>>)`

The pattern should
consist of a leading square bracket followed by a comma-separated list
of values and a closing square bracket.

To access a value out of the vector, use the square bracket operator.

@examples
    {{{
    #!exp
    vector v = vector3(3,2,1);
    float  f = v[0]; # f is 3
    }}}
