= rotaxis =

"""Returns a 4x4 rotation matrix from an angle and a vector."""

:usage: `rotaxis(<<angle>>, <<axisv>>)`

<<angle>> is in degrees.

The rotation is taken from the angle around the axis specified by
the vector <<axisv>>.
The vector is converted to a 3 vector for the purposes of this computation.

Houdini's expression language uses row vectors. Rotation matrices
should appear on the right-hand side of vector-matrix multiplications.

For example, to rotate the vector `[1, 2, 3]` by 10 degrees around the
Y axis:

{{{
vector("[1, 2, 3]") * rotaxis(10, "[0, 1, 0]")
}}}
