= Position, resize, rotate, and crop image layers =

:task:Move, resize, or rotate an image:
    * Use the [Transform operator|Node:cop2/xform] to move, rotate,
      or scale an image _without changing the canvas size_. (If you
      scale the image outside the current canvas size, it will be
      cropped. If you scale it down, the canvas will have empty
      pixels around the resized image.)

    * Use the [Scale operator|Node:cop2/scale] to resize an image
      and change the canvas size.

:task:Crop an image:
    * Use the [Crop operator|Node:cop2/crop] to crop an image and
      change its size.

:task:Crop an image to a shape:
    * See  [how to work with mattes|/composite/mattes] .

:task:Increase the size of the image canvas:
    * Use the [Border operator|Node:cop2/border] to add empty pixels
      around the edges of an image. The border can also write a
      border over existing pixels inside an image.

:task:Do simple perspective and shearing:
    * Use the [Pin operator|Node:cop2/pin] to stretch an image into
      an arbitrary quadrilateral shape.

      The [Unpin operator|Node:cop2/unpin] performs the opposite
      function: it extracts an arbitrary quadrilateral shape from an
      image and stretches it into a regular rectangular shape.

:task:Distort the image:
    * See  [how to distort or convolve an image|distort] .

See [how to work with mattes|/composite/mattes]  for additional ways to resize
[mattes|/composite/mattes] .
