            Instead of entering a filename, use `op:<<path_to_cop_node>>
            `. This will load the Color and Alpha data from the COP node
            as an RGBA image.

            WARNING:
                This will not work in VOPs. The VEX code generated by
                VOPs cannot do this kind of dynamic image reference.

                Instead, fetch the image in the shader node (SHOP) that
                encapsulates the VOP shader network.

            Creates curve geometry from the color contours of an image.
            It has an explicit option to take data from a COP node instead
            of an image file.

            Colors particles based on the pixel colors of an image. It
            has an explicit option to take data from a COP node instead of
            an image file.

            Converts scanlines of an image from a COP node into
            channels. You can fetch sub-regions of the image instead of the
            full image.
