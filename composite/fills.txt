            [Ramp COP|Node:cop2/ramp]

            * The color ramp can blend between any number of colors, and
              you can control blending speed between colors.

            * The ramp can wrap around to create a continuous loop.

            * You can cycle the colors in the ramp.

            * You control the color and strength at each corner.

            * You can add additional points and move corners to produce
              a more general contour image.
