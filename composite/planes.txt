= Work with planes =

:task:Copy image data from one image into a plane of another image:
    # Create a [Channel Copy node|Node:cop2/channelcopy].

    #  [Connect|/ref/panes/network]  the compositing node (usually a [File
      node|Node:cop2/file]) containing the color image to the first
      input, and the compositing node containing the deep raster
      plane to the second input.

    # In the Channel Copy node's parameters, set __Source__ to
      "Input 2" and set __Target__ to the name of the deep raster
      plane you're importing.

:task:Create planes from scratch:
    * Add a  [generator node|/composite/]  and on its
      __Image__ tab set the __Add plane__ parameter.

:task:Use one image as the alpha channel of another image:
    * The [Switch Alpha COP|Node:cop2/switchalpha] moves the alpha
      plane from its second input into its first input.

:task:Use color data as the basis for the alpha channel:
    * See  [keying|keying] .


TIP:
    You can also use the Channel Copy operator to swap image data
    between planes/components or inputs.
