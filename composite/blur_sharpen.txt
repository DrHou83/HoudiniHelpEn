TIP:
    [Blur|Node:cop2/blur], [Defocus|Node:cop2/defocus], and [Sharpen|Node:cop2/sharpen] can use a
    [matte|/composite/mattes]  to control the per-pixel effect amount (black
    is no blur/sharpen, white is maximum blur/sharpen).

TIP:
    The [Transform COP|Node:cop2/xform] and all  [compositing
    operators|/composite/layers]  that have a transformation option let you
    add motion blur to the transformation.

            When animating transformations using the [Transform
            COP|Node:cop2/xform] or the  [compositing
            operators|/composite/layers]  with a transformation option, you
            can add motion blur to the transformation with the __Motion
            blur__ parameter on the __Transform__ tab.

            [Sharpen COP|Node:cop2/sharpen]

            Increase the kernel size to sharpen larger features. The
            kernel size controls how many surrounding pixels to consider
            when the node calculates local contrast.

            Use the __Noise__ parameter to prevent the node from
            sharpening grain and other noise.
