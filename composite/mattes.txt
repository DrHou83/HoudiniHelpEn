= Work with mattes =

A _matte_ is a grayscale image you use as either an alpha channel or a
[mask|/composite/masks]  to isolate certain parts of the image.

For example, if you wanted to crop an image inside a hexagon shape, you
would create a hexagonal matte and connect it to the node's [mask
input|/composite/masks] .

Mattes can be simple (a shape or a gradient) or complex, based on the
colors in the image you want to use the matte on.

:task:Generate mattes:
    * See  [how to create shapes|shapes] ,
      [gradients|fills] , and  [generate mattes based on image
      colors (keying)|keying] .

      You can also  [add noise|noise]  to a matte to give it
      some variation.

:task:Use a matte to isolate part of an image:
    * Connect the matte to a node's  [mask input|/composite/masks] .

    * Connect the image to the first input of a [Switch Alpha
      node|Node:cop2/switchalpha], and connect the matte to the
      second input. The Switch Alpha operator copies the second
      input to the alpha channel of the first input. Turn on the
      __Redo premultiply__ parameter to override any previous
      premultiplication.

    * Use the [Premultiply operator|Node:cop2/premultiply] to use a
      matte stored in a plane of the image you want to isolate. Use
      the name of the matte plane in the __Alpha__ parameter.

    * Connect the image to the input of the node generating the
      matte. In the __Image__ tab of the matte node's parameter
      editor, change the __Add image__ parameter to "C (RGB)" and
      "Multiply".

:task:Shrink or enlarge mattes:
    * Use the [Expand|Node:cop2/expand] or [Dilate
      Erode|Node:cop2/dilateerode] operator to shrink or enlarge mattes.

      The Dilate Erode operator is faster, but does not provide good
      quality for large changes. The Expand operator is slower, but
      produces higher quality.

:task:Adjust edges and falloff of a matte:
    * Because mattes are just grayscale images, you can use the full
      complement of image-manipulation tools in the compositor to
      adjust mattes.

      Use the [Gamma operator|Node:cop2/gamma] to reduce falloff at
      the low end (gamma < 1) or high end (gamma > 1).

    * Use an [Expand operator|Node:cop2/expand] with zero size and a
      small __Dropoff__ to add a bit of falloff to a map.

    * Use the [Blur operator|Node:cop2/blur] with a Gaussian blur to
      soften a matte. You can also use the [Edge Blur
      operator|Node:cop2/edgeblur], which blurs based on edge
      detection and so may preserve fine details of the map better.

:task:Combine mattes:
    * Use the  [compositing operators|/composite/layers]  to combine
      mattes.

      To get the union of two mattes, use the
      [Screen|Node:cop2/screen], [Maximum|Node:cop2/max], or
      [Add|Node:cop2/add] operator. To take the union but cut out
      overlapping areas, use the [XOR operator|Node:cop2/xor].

      To get the intersection of two mattes, use the [Minimum
      operator|Node:cop2/min]. To cut one matte out of another, use
      the [Subtract operator|Node:cop2/subtract].

      To use one operator to modulate another, use the [Multiply
      operator|Node:cop2/multiply].
