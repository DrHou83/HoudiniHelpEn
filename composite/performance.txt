                Use the resolution menu in the compositing viewer's             toolbars to cook at different scale factors of the image resolution, from 12.5% to 800%. Reducing the image resolution results in faster cooking.

                In a compositing viewer, hold ((Shift)) and drag a box
                around the part of the image you're interested in.

                To return to the full image, click the __Clear
                Selection__ button (on the Adapt toolbar) or hold
                ((Shift)) and click black space outside the image.

                Do interactive cooking at a lower resolution.
            td>>
                When you drag a handle or parameter slider, the image
                automatically scales down to a much lower resolution (by
                default, a quarter of the current resolution) . When you
                release the mouse button, the image returns to its
                normal resolution and does a longer cook.

                You can specify the resolution reduction factor, the
                minimum image resolution to enable this mode and other
                options in the Compositing Preferences. Choose
                __Edit > Preferences > Compositing__ to open the __Compositing__
		section of the [Houdini Preferences|/ref/windows/mainprefs#comp]
		window. Click the __Interactive__ tab and set the
		__Interactive Rendering Fraction__.

                When Incremental mode is enabled, as tiles are cooked,
                the image in the viewport is updated. The image starts
                out as a dull gray and slowly gets filled in by the
                cooked tiles.

                Click an area to cook that area of the image
                immediately. Press ((Esc)) or click ((RMB)) in the
                viewport to interrupt cooking at any time.

                To turn off image updates during cooking, choose
                __Edit > Preferences > Compositing__ to open the __Compositing__
		section of the [Houdini Preferences|/ref/windows/mainprefs#comp]
		window. Click the __Interactive__ tab and set __Cooking feedback__ to
		__None__ or __Progress Bar__.

                Use the bypass flag and scoping.
            td>>
                COPs that are bypassed do not make a copy of input data.
                Similarly, if an operation is only scoped to affect the
                Color plane, any other planes will be "passed through"
                the COP without any copying or cooking.

                Timing and management COPs (such as Shift or Merge) do
                not copy image data unless necessary (i.e., the
                resolution is different, or frames need to be blended
                together).

                Increase the size of the compositing cook cache.
            td>>
                Choose __Editing > Preferences > Compositing__ to open the
		__Compositing__ section of the [Houdini Preferences|/ref/windows/mainprefs#comp]
                window. Increase the __Interactive Cache Size__ value.
        tr>>

                Use more processors.
            td>> 
                The compositor supports cooking on more than one local CPU, which results in almost halving (two CPUs) or quartering (four CPUs) the cook time. There is no benefit to multi-threading on single CPU workstations. The compositor supports up to 8 cooking threads.

            td>>
                If you only need the color data, only write out the
                color plane. You can specify which planes to save in the
                [output driver node|/composite/save]  and the  [flipbook
                dialog|view] .
        tr>>
            td>> Batch cook frames.
            td>>
                If you have a multi-processor machine, and your network
                references data from the previous frame, or your network
                is small, turn on __Batch cook frames__ in the  [output
                driver|/composite/save] . This makes the compositor generates
                two frames at a time.

                You can increase the batch rate if you have more than
                two processors (for example, if you have quad-processor
                machine you can increase the batch rate to 3 for even
                better performance).
