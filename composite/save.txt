= Save composited data to disk =

:task:Save the image in a node:
    * Press ((RMB)) on the node tile and choose __Save Image__.
        
:task:Save the image in the viewer:
    * Press ((RMB)) in the viewer and choose __Save Image__.

:task:Render the result of a compositing network:
    Create a [Composite render node|Node:out/comp] (in a render network), or a [ROP file output compositing node|Node:cop2/rop_comp] (in a compositing network) and point it at the compositing node to render.
        
    Using a [Composite render node|Node:out/comp] lets you set up [render dependencies|/render/batch] between renders and compositing jobs.

TIP:
    You can optionally apply a  [color look-up table (LUT)|luts]
    to the output as you save it.

== Mapping planes to image channels ==

    When you save to a file format that supports deep rasters (Houdini
    `pic` format), you can save all planes. When you save image data to
    a non-deep raster image file format such as TIFF, you can map
    different planes to the 3 or 4 channels available.

    For example, the regular mapping would be to store the Color
    channels (`C.r`, `C.g`, `C.b`) in the TIFF's RGB channels and the
    Alpha (`A`) plane in the TIFF's Alpha channel. However, you could
    instead choose to store the Normal plane in the TIFF's RGB channels,
    and store the Depth plane in the TIFF's Alpha channel.
