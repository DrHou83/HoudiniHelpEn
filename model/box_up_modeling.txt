= "Box up" modeling =

== Overview ==

"Box up" modeling refers to starting with a basic shape such as a polygonal [box|/shelf/box] or [sphere|/shelf/sphere] and then adding, extruding, modifying, cutting, deleting, smoothing, etc. polygons to build up the shape you want.

Another way of modeling is ["curve up" modeling|curve_up_modeling], where you create construction curves that define shapes, then use tools such as [Revolve|/shelf/revolve] and [Loft|/shelf/loft] to create surfaces from the curves.

See the [Model tab|/shelf/model] on the shelf for more modeling tools.

== Tools ==

See [how to create geometry|create].

Moving points:
    See [how to edit points|edit_points].
    
Extrude faces/edges:
    [PolyExtrude|/shelf/polyextrude] tool on the *Polygon* shelf tab. This shelf tool creates a [Poly Extrude surface node|Node:sop/polyextrude].
    
Split faces:
    [PolySplit|/shelf/polysplit] tool on the *Polygon* shelf tab. This shelf tool creates a [Poly Split surface node|Node:sop/polysplit].

Remove faces:
    [Select|/basics/select] the faces and press ((Del)).
    
    [Delete|/shelf/delete] tool on the *Modify* shelf tab. This shelf tool creates a [Blast surface node|Node:sop/blast].
    
Smooth polygons without adding points:
    [Smooth|/shelf/smooth] tool on the *Polygon* shelf tab.
    
    To smooth points by painting, use the [Sculpt|/shelf/sculpt] tool on the *Model* shelf tab. In the viewer, press ((RMB)) and set one of the mouse buttons to __Smooth points__. Use the __Opacity__ control to set the amount of smoothing.
    
Increase the number of polygons with optional smoothing:
    Use the [Subdivide|/shelf/subdivide] tool on the *Polygon* shelf tab. This shelf tool creates a [Subdivide node|Node:sop/subdivide] which divides polygons into smoother, higher-resolution polygons.
      
== Tips ==

Use the following tips to set up for box-up polygonal modeling:

* You can [place an image in the background of the 3D viewer|/basics/view]  as a reference for modeling.

* You can turn on __Link Ortho Views__ in the viewport layout menu (in the toolbar across the top of the viewer pane) to make the top/front/side viewports pan and zoom together (see the [section on the view|/basics/view]).

* Press ((P)) in the viewer to overlay a parameter editor for the current operator/tool.
