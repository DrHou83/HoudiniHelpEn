:task:Move, rotate, or scale points, faces, and edges:
    # [Select|/basics/select] points ((2)), faces ((3)), or edges ((4)).

    # Click [Icon:TOOLS/move] Move, [Icon:TOOLS/rotate] Rotate, or [Icon:TOOLS/scale] Scale in the toolbox down the left side of the viewer.
        
    # Use the [handle|/basics/handles] in the viewer to move, rotate, or scale the selected components.
        
        When moving points, you can use the __Soft radius__ control in the operation toolbar to add a soft fall-off to each movement.

        When __Soft radius__ is greater than 0, moving the selected point(s) also moves surrounding points by a smaller amount based on distance.

:task:Edit points by painting:
    Use the [Sculpt tool|/shelf/sculpt] on the *Model* shelf to push, pull, or smooth points. See [how to use brush tools|/basics/brush] for basic information on the brushing interface.
        
    You can also use the [Paint surface node|Node:sop/paint] to paint color or other [attributes|attributes] onto a surface.

:task:Edit normals:
    
    Houdini has four types of normals: plane normals, point normals, vertex normals, and surface normals. They indicate the orientation (direction) of a point, plane, vertex, or surface curve.
        
    If a curve is planar and does not share its points with other primitives, its default point, vertex, and primitive normals are identical: perpendicular to the plane of the curve.
    
    Use the icons in the display toolbar (on the right side of the viewer) to show or hide [Icon:VIEW/display_point_normals] point normals and/or [Icon:VIEW/display_primitive_normals] face normals.
    
    Use the [Comb tool|/shelf/comb] on the *Character* tab of the shelf to reorient normals by painting.
            
    Use a [Point node|Node:sop/point] to set the normal vector of points manually.
