#helpid: h.pane.datatree.appearance

"""The _appearance editor_ mode of the [data tree pane|/ref/panes/datatree] lets you edit various controls for object viewport/rendered appearance in one place."""

When you edit controls in the appearance spreadsheet, the pane modifies the corresponding controls on the object (or in the case of packed geometry, modifies a [Packed Edit node|Node:sop/packededit] to set the appropriate attributes).

== How to ==

:task:Create an appearance editor pane:
    # Click the [Icon:BUTTONS/new_tab] New tab icon in the top line of a pane.

    # Choose __New pane tab type > Data tree__.
    
    # Click the pop-up menu in the top left corner and choose "Appearance editor".

== Things to know ==

* If you import Alembic geometry (or otherwise import packed geometry), you must append a [Packed Edit SOP|Node:sop/packededit] to the geometry network.
    
    This is because, unlike regular editable geometry, the display of packed geometry is controlled by _attributes_ on the geometry, which the Packed Edit node changes. The appearance editor works by modifying how the node sets the attributes.

* If you are editing the geometry inside an object at the _geometry level_, the full geometry is always displayed, even if the data tree shows it as "hidden" at the object level. See [object and geometry level|/basics/objects] for more information.

* The [Smallicon:NODEFLAGS/display] "Display" checkbox controls the [display flag|/nodes/obj/] on objects. The object node display flag affects display *and* rendering.

* The "Display type" column changes the object's __Display as__ parameter (on the __Render__ tab). This only affects display, not rendering.

* The "Material" column changes the object's __Material__ parameter (on the __Material__ tab).

== Toolbar ==

Pop-up menu:
    The pop-up menu at the top left sets which user interface the [data tree pane|/ref/panes/datatree] displays.

Filter:
    Type a _pattern_ (_not_ a sub-string), for example `sphere*`, and press ((Enter)). Only names matching this pattern will show in the spreadsheet.

Follow selection:
    Turn this off to prevent clicks in the editor from selecting geometry.

== Path attribute ==

You can add a `path` attribute to primitives to specify their location in the data tree hierarchy. This is a slash-separated string. For example, two primitives with the `path` attributes `obj/foo/bar` and `obj/foo/baz` would create the following hierarchy.

{{{
obj
   foo
      bar
      baz
}}}

Geometry [imported from an Alembic file|/io/alembic] automatically has this attribute set to match the internal object hierarchy of the Alembic file.
