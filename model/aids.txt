== Grids ==

Houdini has two grids: the _reference plane_ which helps you orient yourself in 3D space, and the _construction plane_ which tools place things relative to.


=== Reference plane ===

The default infinite XZ grid shown in the viewer is the _reference plane_.

[Image:/images/ui/reference_grid.jpg]

:task: Show or hide the reference plane:
    Click the [Icon:VIEW/display_reference_plane] Display reference plane icon (on the display toolbar to the right of the view).

:task: Customize the reference plane grid:
    Right-click the [Icon:VIEW/display_reference_plane] Display reference plane icon (on the display toolbar to the right of the view) and choose __Reference plane parameters__.
    
    See the [reference grid parameters|#grid_parms] below.

    TIP:
        You can set the __Ruler type__ directly from the right-click menu on the icon.


=== Construction plane ===

Many modeling operations, such as creating a new objects using the tools in the Create shelf tab and drawing curves, are relative to the _construction plane_.

The default construction plane is the same as the reference plane (an XZ grid centered on the origin).

You can change the display of the grid on the construction plane, or move/reorient the construction plane to make it easier to model in an area not centered on the origin, or in a space other than the XZ ground plane.

The viewport menu (in the top right corner of each viewport) contains controls for manipulating the construction plane.

:task: Show or hide the construction plane:
    Click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display construction plane icon (on the display toolbar to the right of the view).

:task: Use a handle to move the construction plane:
    # Click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display construction plane icon to turn on the construction plane. (You might also want to turn off the [Icon:VIEW/display_reference_plane] to avoid confusion).

    # Click the viewport menu and turn on __Construction plane handle__.

    # Click the [Icon:TOOLS/handles] Handles tool (in the toolbox to the left of the view).
    
    # Use the handle to move and rotate the construction plane.

:task: Set the construction plane perpendicular to the current viewing direction:
    # Click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display construction plane icon to turn on the construction plane. (You might also want to turn off the [Icon:VIEW/display_reference_plane] to avoid confusion).
    
    # Click the viewport menu and turn on __Set construction plane > Align c-plane with viewing plane__.

:task: Align the construction plane with a polygon:
    # Click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display construction plane icon to turn on the construction plane. (You might also want to turn off the [Icon:VIEW/display_reference_plane] to avoid confusion).
    
    # Click the viewport menu and turn on __Set construction plane > Start orientation picking__.
    
    # Select three points on the polygon to define a triangle.
    
        Houdini aligns the construction plane to the three selected points.

:task: Customize the reference plane grid:
    Right-click the [Icon:VIEW/display_construction_plane] Display reference plane icon (on the display toolbar to the right of the view) and choose __Reference plane parameters__.
    
    See the [reference grid parameters|#grid_parms] below.

:task: Return the construction plane to the default:
    # Click the viewport menu and turn on __Set construction plane > Revert to defaults__.


=== Parameters === (grid_parms)

Grid spacing:
    How far apart (in Houdini units) to draw the grid lines.

Grid ruler:
    Show numbers on the axes at these intervals. For example, `5` means show numbers on the grid at 5, 10, 15, and so on. See also the __Ruler type__ option below.

Origin:
    Center the grid plane around this point (in world units). An easier way to position the construction plane is to use its handle (see above).

Normal:
    Orient the grid plane around this vector from the origin (in world units). An easier way to orient the construction plane is to use its handle or the orientation items in the viewport menu (see above).

Ruler type:
    No ruler:
        Don't show numbers on the grid.
    
    Ruler on main axis:
        Show numbers on the vertical and horizontal axes.
    
    Ruler on grid points:
        Show numbers across the entire grid.


== Snapping ==

:fig:[Image:/images/ui/snapping_menu.png]
    Use the snapping icons in the toolbox (one the left side of the viewer pane) to turn snapping on and off.

    Right-click, or press and hold, an icon to see a menu of options.

    [Icon:TOOLS/snap_grid] Snap to grid:
        Snap to points on the construction plane.
    
    [Icon:TOOLS/snap_curve] Snap to primitives:
        Snap to curves and edges.
    
    [Icon:TOOLS/snap_point] Snap to points:
        Snaps to points.

    [Icon:TOOLS/snap] Multi-snap:
        Snap to different things simultaneously. Right-click to open the options menu and choose __Multi-snapping options__ to set priorities for individual types of snapping.


=== Options menu ===

Templates:
    At the [Geometry level|/basics/objects], you can snap to [templated geometry|/nodes/sop] (geometry that is made visible for reference purposes, using the template flag).
    
Other objects:
    At the [Geometry level|/basics/objects], you can snap to geometry from _other objects_, not just the object you are inside.

X-ray geometry:
    At the Object level, you can snap to geometry in objects with the [X-ray flag|/network/flags#obj] set.

Occlusion:
    Prevents snapping to geometry hidden (occluded) behind shaded surfaces. When Occlusion is on, you can only snap to visible geometry.

Depth snapping:
    If you turn this option off, you can snap to reference geometry, but the point stays on the construction plane.

Interior snapping:
    Snap to the midline of enclosing geometry under the cursor.

Orient on snap:
    When you snap one object to another, normally the orientation of the object will remain the same and only its location will change. If this option is turned on, the object will rotate according to the preference set in the [snapping options window|/ref/windows/snapoptions].  The default is to rotate so the closest major axis (x, y, z) points in the direction of the thing you are snapping to.
    
Multi-snapping options:
    Open the [snapping options window|/ref/windows/snapoptions] containing additional options. For multi-snapping, this window lets you give each type of snapping different priorities so, for example, snapping to points overrides snapping to edges.


== Align handles or construction plane == (align)
#index: document
#bestbet: align

:task: Align an object to the construction plane:
    # Select the object.
    
    # Right click the object's handle and choose __Align handle > C-plane axes__.

:task: Align to geometry:
    # To align an object, select the object, right click its handle, and choose __Align handle > Start orientation picking__.

        To align the construction plane, click the viewport menu (the left menu in the top right corner of the viewport) and choose __Set construction plane > Start orientation picking__, or press [;|Key:h.pane.gview.handle.xform.click_orient].
        
        TIP:
            You can also *hold* the [;|Key:h.pane.gview.handle.xform.click_orient] hotkey to enable orientation, and then either click to align (see below) or release the key to cancel.

    # Hover over the geometry you want to align to.

        You can align to a point, edge, or face.

    # Click the geometry to align the object with the geometry. Different modifier keys perform different operations:

        * Click the geometry to move the object to its position.
    
        * ((Shift + LMB)) to rotate the object to align with the geometry normal (the object does not move).
    
        * ((Ctrl + LMB)) to move and rotate the object.
    
        * ((Shift + Ctrl + LMB)) to rotate the object to point at the geometry.
    
        _or_
    
        * Right click the handle again and choose __Align handle > Cancel orientation picking__.

    NOTE:
        Currently you can only align along the +Z direction of the object.

:task: Align to a plane defined by selecting multiple points/edges:
    The "extended" method for aligning by clicking points from previous versions of Houdini is still available as an option.
    
    * Turn on display of points in the 3D viewer (using the display toolbar to the right of the view).
    
    * While in "orientation picking" mode (see above), right-click to get an option menu. At the top, choose __Extended mode__.
    
    * In this mode, you can click three points (or an edge and a point, or two edges) to define a plane the handles/c-plane will align to.
