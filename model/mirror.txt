= Mirror geometry across a symmetry plane =

Use the [Icon:SOP/mirror] [Mirror tool|/shelf/mirror] on the *Modify* shelf tab to mirror copy _objects or geometry_ (depending on whether you use the tool at the [Scene or Geometry level|/basics/objects]).

At the object level, this is useful for rigging one side of a character and then duplicating the bones to the other side. As you duplicate, you can automatically rename nodes, for example `r_arm` is mirrored as `l_arm`.

The [Mirror Capture tool|/shelf/mirrorcaptureweights] on the *Character* shelf tab lets you mirror copy capture attributes (attributes specifying which bones control which parts of the character's skin) from one side of a character's skin to the other. See [capturing character geometry|/character/captureregions] for more information.

TIP:
    You can add a Mirror node to the network and set its [display flag|/nodes/sop/], then edit upstream nodes and see the changes reflected in the mirrored geometry.

NOTE:
    If the duplicated geometry has  [point attributes|attributes], the
    Mirror node mirrors them as well.
