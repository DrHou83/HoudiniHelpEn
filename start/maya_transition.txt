"""Basic differences between user interface concepts, terms, and hotkeys in Maya and Houdini."""

== Welcome ==

Welcome to Houdini! This guide shows a few basic translations between Maya(tm) and Houdini to help Maya users get up to speed more quickly.

We hope that Maya users will use this guide as starting point, and then explore Houdini's unique node-based procedural workflow and all the benefits it has that don't have equivalents in Maya.

NOTE:
    *On the Mac*, use ((Cmd)) instead of ((Ctrl)).

Houdini treats objects and components slightly differently than Maya(tm).

In Maya, every piece of geometry you create is an object, and you combine objects using modeling commands to create new objects. An object's _construction history_ lets you access the nodes that contributed to the object.

In Houdini, the _Geometry Container objects_ represents animate-able models, alongside other object types such as lights, cameras, and bones. Geometry container objects have a network of _surface nodes_ inside that define the object's geometry.

In Houdini, you often alternate between creating, combining, parenting, and animating objects at the Scene level, and modeling using surface nodes inside Geometry container objects (the Geometry level).

== Viewing ==

In Houdini, you traditionally hold ((Space)) and drag in the viewer to change the view. However, you can also hold ((Alt)) as in Maya.

== Moving data ==

Houdini imports and exports Alembic and FBX formats, allowing seamless transition of entire Maya scenes into Houdini.

If you only need to transfer geometry between Maya and Houdini, Houdini's File surface node and Geometry render node can read and write common geometry formats such as OBJ.

See more information on [Alembic|/io/alembic], [FBX|/io/fbx], the [File surface node|Node:sop/file], and the [Geometry render node|Node:out/geometry].
